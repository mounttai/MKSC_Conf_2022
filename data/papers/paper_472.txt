3 - Estimating View-through Ad Attribution from User Surveys using Convex Optimization Yuhan Lin, Wealthfront, Palo Alto, CA Rohan Kekatpure, Cassidy Yeung In Digital Marketing, robust quantification of View-through attribution (VTA) is necessary for evaluating channel effectiveness. VTA occurs when a product purchase is aided by an Ad, but without an explicit click (e.g. a TV ad). A lack of a tracking mechanism makes VTA estimation challenging. One prevalent technique uses a post-purchase in-product user survey to estimate VTA. User surveys enable the calculation of channel multipliers, which are the ratio of the View-through to the Click-through purchases attributed to  each marketing channel. Channel multipliers provide a way to estimate the unknown VTA for each marketing channel from its known click attribution. In this work, we use Convex Optimization to compute channel multipliers in a way that enables a mathematical encoding of the expected channel behavior. Large fluctuations in channel attributions often result from overfitting the calculations to user surveys. Casting channel attribution as a Convex Optimization problem allows an introduction of constraints that limit such fluctuations. The result of our study is a distribution of channel multipliers across the entire marketing funnel, with important implications for marketing spend optimization.Our technique can be broadly applied to estimate Ad effectiveness in a privacy-centric world that increasingly limits user tracking.
