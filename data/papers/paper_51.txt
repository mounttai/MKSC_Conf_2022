4 - Online Employer Reviews - On the Interplay Between Money and Workplace Vibes Andreas Bayerl, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany Jacob Goldenberg, Danny Shapira, Florian Stahl In this paper we study the newly emergent type of user- generated content platforms that collect and share employee- generated content (EGC) about companies, with the goal of helping job seekers find a job and company they love (Glassdoor 2021). In particular, we examine online employer reviews from two perspectives. First, from the perspective of someone writing and sharing a review (employee perspective), we show that a company’s workplace vibes have a greater impact on employees’ workplace recommendations than salary. This finding is most pronounced for employees in relatively well-paid jobs. We find that above a certain threshold, higher salaries are even associated with a decreasing likelihood to recommend the employer. This counter-intuitive result concerning high salaries is due to a personal cost-benefit tradeoff that develops unfavorably towards the personal costs and against the personal benefits of additional salary. Second, from the perspective of someone who is searching for an ideal job and considering employer reviews in his/her decision to apply for available positions in a company (job seeker perspective), we document that EGC is able to capture good vibes at companies and make them apparent to the outside world. As a result, companies can benefit from having good online employer reviews through a higher likelihood of filling an open position, a decreased likelihood that candidates reject an offer, and the possibility to pay less while applicants still accept a job with the same likelihood.
