3 - Social Movements, Identity and Gender Stereotypes: How did #metoo Affect Footwear Consumption? Clement Bellet, Assistant Professor, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands We examine whether and how #MeToo—a preeminent global social movement against sexual abuse and harassment— affected consumer demand for products displaying traditional markers of femininity in the footwear market. To do so, we analyzed comprehensive high-frequency product-level stockout data from a leading global fashion retailer spanning 5.2 million observations from January 2017 to December 2018 in 32 OECD countries (covering 89% of the population of OECD members). Using a triple-difference strategy over time, across countries, and between product attributes, we found that #MeToo reduced product-level stockouts along two major design dimensions traditionally associated with femininity: colors (pink or red shoes) and form (slim shapes and heel height emphasizing silhouette and gait). Consistent with a demand-side effect, we find no evidence of short-term supply-side changes in reaction to #MeToo (e.g., changes in product assortments). Local heightened sensitivity to identity threat after #MeToo—captured by online searches around sexual harassment—is consistent with the documented effect. We discuss the results’ implications for firms’ communication strategies as they relate to customer identity, as well as for our understanding of the role of social movements in shaping signaling dynamics in the marketplace.
