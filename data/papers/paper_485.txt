2 - Profits and Positivity with Body Neutrality: Analyzing the Impact of Fashion Brands’ Use of Non-skinny Models on Consumer Choice Chen (Chelsea) Cao, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong Zijun (June) Shi, Shunyuan Zhang Recently, body neutrality, a social movement that embraces equality and acceptance for all bodies, has been increasingly gaining traction among public. Fashion brands including Nike and Lululemon have started to use plus-size models in their marketing and promotion, opposite to the field’s long history of preferring skinny/underweight models. Yet, the impact of practicing size-inclusive on consumer choice and on brand’s economics remains an empirically open question. This research aims to fill the gap by analyzing a unique longitudinal dataset consisting of customers searches and purchases on a leading e-commerce platform in Asia. From the displayed images of over 100,000 fashion products, we employ a self-correlation human parsing deep learning model to predict the model’s body size (operationalized as the Body Mass Index—BMI). We also control for a rich set of clothes attributes and characteristics of the model that we extract from the display images. Exploiting the variation in the BMIs of models, we examine how using a plus-size and normal-size model, compared to using a skinny model, impacts sales of the focal product and of the parent brand. We further examine the consequences in customers’ search and future purchases, after a customer was exposed to or purchased a product using a plus-size (normal-size) model. The after-sales analyses reveal interesting patterns with regard to consumer purchasing and searching across product sizes, brands, and categories. We discuss the managerial and policy implications of our findings.
