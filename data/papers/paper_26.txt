2 - Announcement Effects on Vaccine Discussions Dinesh Puranam, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA Piyush Anand, Vrinda Kadiyali The Covid-19 pandemic has brought a long-running debate on vaccinations to the forefront. On one hand, anti-vaxxers hold that vaccines are harmful and can lead to dangerous side effects in children like autism. Pro-vaxxers believe the opposite. As the science on Covid-19 vaccines (and their side effects) evolved during the pandemic, public authorities like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made vaccine-related announcements that included both successes and failures. For example, the J&J vaccine distribution was put on hold when it was discovered that the vaccine could lead to blood clots. These announcements could influence public perceptions and rates of vaccine hesitancy and have long-term consequences on healthcare consumption. Consequently, we estimate the effect of vaccine related announcements on vaccine discussions and stance from public discourse on Twitter. Specifically, we examine how these announcements affect a) vaccine stance (both for and against), and b) engagement across the political spectrum. Methodologically, we extend transformer-based models to predict stance from tweet text and supplemental user-level metadata. To quantify the effect of an announcement on vaccine stance we adapt Bayesian structural time series models to an event study framework. Overall, we find that Pro Vaccine activity and engagement has increased significantly. Effects are short lived with respect to announcements, but the cumulative impact is sustained. Our findings are relevant to both policymakers and marketers dealing with polarized consumers.
