4 - Leveraging Musical Attributes in Brand Videos to Drive user Engagement on Social Media Vamsi K. Kanuri, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN  The widespread use of social media videos to increase a brand’s reach through virality has drawn scholarly attention to the visual components of videos, but research on their audio features remains scant. In this paper, we explore whether tempo variation - a key audio feature that captures the break in the pace of sounds when beat occurrences speed up or slow down - can influence the virality of brand videos. Using state-of-the-art feature extraction techniques to mine second- by-second frames of audio features from unstructured data involving 5,430,960 seconds from 69,374 videos posted by 548 brands on their dedicated Facebook pages over a 6-year period, we find a strong negative association between tempo variation in brand videos and the number of times videos are shared on the social media platform. Heterogeneity in this association provides suggestive evidence that this link is due to auditory distraction, whereby tempo changes trigger an orienting response in consumers towards understanding the new sound progression, which can interfere with information processing and reduce virality. We further confirm this process by leveraging an exogenous change to Facebook’s video sound policy. Our results are robust to a range of econometric models, matching specifications and sensitivity analyses, and have implications for engineering video virality and applications in multimedia content design.
