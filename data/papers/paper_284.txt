2 - Does Strategy-Customer Alignment Payoff? Narendra K Bosukonda, Doctoral Student, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX Shrihari Sridhar, Vikas Mittal, Sonam Singh Popular press is replete with the prescription that a company’s strategy should be aligned with its customers to help deliver superior financial performance. Yet, extant literature lacks 1) an objective measure of strategy-customer alignment 2) empirical research linking strategy-customer alignment and objective financial performance 3) an understanding of how strategy-customer alignment affects senior executives’ attitudes and behaviors. Our research addresses these gaps in literature. To measure the alignment between a company’s business strategy and its customers we introduce the multidimensional construct of strategy-customer alignment. We conduct two empirical studies. In Study 1, using data from 17,251 customer surveys of 127 companies, and employing a machine learning approach, we measure strategy-customer alignment at the company-year level and show that alignment is positively associated with revenues, profits and negatively associated with costs. A 1% increase in strategy-customer alignment can increase revenues by 2.3%, reduce cost of selling by 1.8% and increase gross profits by 1.5%. In Study 2, we collected 1,122 survey responses from customers and 745 survey responses from senior executives to measure strategy-customer alignment at employee level. We find that as strategy-customer alignment increases, coordination costs  among senior executives decrease, the use of accountability metrics increase, and this leads to increase in the senior executives’ perceived strategy effectiveness.
