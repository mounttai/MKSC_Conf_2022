1 - Shopping Distancing: The Impact of Travel Cost on Shopping Destination Choices Albert Valenti, IESE Business School, Barcelona, Spain Victor Martinez-de-Albeniz Travel cost is a primary factor driving consumer choice of shopping destination. We analytically formulate how changes in travel cost sensitivity affect shopping destination choices. We show that increases in the sensitivity to travel cost can lead to increases in propensity to shop for destinations that are close to the individual. Using population-wide data sets of mall visits from four cities in two countries, we show that the COVID-19 pandemic increased the travel cost sensitivity during the lockdowns between 115% and 35%, depending on the city, and between 60% and 3% during the reopening phases. Besides temporal and location heterogeneity, we show that customer characteristics and environmental factors related to individual ability to choose significantly influence travel cost sensitivity changes. Our findings shed light on the implications of urban mobility policies that affect travel costs and are relevant for retail managers to assess consumer sensitivity changes to distance.
