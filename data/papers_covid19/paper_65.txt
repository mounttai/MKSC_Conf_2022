1 - What Makes Customers Come Back? : Satisfaction, Intention, and Retention in the Casino Industry Pre Post COVID-19 Sanghee Nina Kim, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA Thomas S Gruca There is a growing body of evidence that customer satisfaction increases customer retention and retention drives firm performance. However, empirical studies of this relationship are generally limited to aggregate, firm- level analyses. The few studies that model individuals tend to focus on either the links between satisfaction and behavioral intentions or satisfaction and actual behavior. At the same time, satisfaction does not have a consistently positive effect on retention. This study reexamines the link between customer satisfaction and actual as mediated by behavioral intention, e.g., repurchase intention. Using individual customer levels of data from the casino industry, we establish the causal mechanisms among satisfaction, behavioral intention, and retention. This study extends the concept of retention beyond the usual binary view (Yes/No) by modeling changes in spending amount and recency versus customer history. These metrics provide managers with a better guideline for diagnosing and monitoring the effects of satisfaction on customer behaviors. Furthermore, the casino industry went through lockdown due to Covid-19 which allows us to examine the robustness of the relationships among satisfaction, intentions, and actual behaviors in the setting of a natural experiment. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of what factors drive customer retention, visit recency, and spending behavior.
