2 - Automatically Discovering Unknown Product Attributes Impacting Consumer Preferences Ankit Sisodia, Yale University, New Haven, CT Alex Burnap, Vineet Kumar  Marketing models typically focus on understanding how structured product attributes impact consumer preferences. However, obtaining attributes present in unstructured data (e.g. text or images), although important, rely on human (expert) judgment. Our research building on recent advances in disentangled representations (with statistical independence and semantic meaning) in deep learning aims to discover such attributes from unstructured data automatically, without human intervention. The recent deep learning literature has emphasized supervision of the discovered attributes on ground truth, as unsupervised approaches are not theoretically guaranteed to discover unique disentangled representations. Our approach does not require ground truth on the visual attributes, which is assumed in most of the literature. We instead use readily available structured product attributes as supervisory signals and identify which signals work best. Our approach is practically useful since we do not need to specify the number of attributes or their meaning, yet we discover semantically interpretable and statistically independent attributes. We apply this approach to automatically discover visual product attributes of high-end watches auctioned at Christie’s and discover 6 semantically interpretable visual attributes providing a disentangled representation. We find that supervisory signals such as `brand’ promote disentanglement relative to the unsupervised approach, but surprisingly `price’ does not.
