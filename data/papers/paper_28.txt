4 - Amazon vs. Walmart: A Comparative Analysis of Responsiveness to the COVID-19 Pandemic Lakshmi Vana, Dartmouth College Tuck School of Business, Hanover, NH Sharmistha Sikdar, Vrinda Kadiyali As the Covid-19 pandemic brought about lockdowns and restrictions on movement, retail sales increasingly moved online with online retail sales increasing by 37% year-on-year in 2020 in the US. This increase was largely fueled by the growth of the two largest retailers, Amazon and Walmart. In this research, we construct time-series data of over 1,500 identical products belonging to 7 product categories sold on Amazon as well as Walmart from June 2020 to December 2021 and explore how the price, stocking, and shipping evolved pre- and post-peaks of Covid waves in the US. In addition, we also identify products that were sold uniquely only on either Amazon or Walmart but not both and compare how the price, stocking and shipping evolved for these products compared to the ones sold on both the platforms. Lastly, we augment the analysis by analyzing the text content of online reviews for these products posted during the data duration on the two platforms to provide supporting evidence for the mechanism for our results.
