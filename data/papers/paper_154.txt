1 - Demand Uncertainty and Sales Force Compensation Design Rob Waiser, Assistant Professor, London Business School, London, United Kingdom David Soberman Standard models of sales force compensation design (e.g. Basu et al, 1985) indicate that the convexity or concavity of the optimal compensation plan (i.e., whether commission rates increase or decrease with sales) depends on the risk  aversion characteristics of the salesperson. In this research, we propose an alternative mechanism that can drive the shape of the optimal compensation curve in practice -- demand uncertainty and asymmetric information. We use a game theoretic model to examine optimal sales force compensation design when a risk-neutral firm and salesperson face uncertainty about the demand for their product at the time of contracting. After the contract is signed, the salesperson learns about the demand conditions and can adjust her selling effort accordingly. We find that the shape of the optimal commission curve depends on how selling effort affects the probability distribution of sales outcomes, given demand conditions. For example, it may be the case that under low demand, salesperson effort mainly shifts probability from low to intermediate sales outcomes, while under high demand conditions, effort primarily shifts probability from intermediate to high outcomes. Alternatively, high demand might imply that the product sells itself, in which case effort is less impactful than under low demand. In general, we find that increasing commissions are optimal only when the effect of selling effort on the likelihood of high outcomes is sufficiently large regardless of the demand condition. When effort primarily drives intermediate outcomes under either high or low demand, decreasing commissions are optimal. We also identify a range of conditions under which piecewise commissions perfectly manage asymmetric information and elicit efficient effort from salespeople.
