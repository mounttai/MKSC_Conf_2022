1 - Safety Reviews on Airbnb: An Information Tale Zhe Jin, University of Maryland, College Park, MD Aron Culotta, Liad Wagman Many online platforms facilitate and publish user reviews in order to build trust between anonymous buyers and sellers. At the same time, platforms can also monitor, filter, and remove certain user reviews, even if they reflect the true experiences of buyers. Using Airbnb and official crime data in five major US cities, we show that a recent Airbnb policy that discourages reviews about the safety of a listingâ€™s vicinity, if fully implemented, would hurt guests but increase revenues from reservations on Airbnb, with positive sorting towards listings with such vicinity safety reviews. Because vicinity safety reviews are more closely correlated with official crime statistics  in low-income and minority neighborhoods, our findings suggest that suppressing or highlighting vicinity safety reviews would have different effects on different neighborhoods.
