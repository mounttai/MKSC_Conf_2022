2 - Geo-targeted Mobile Advertising for Small Businesses Mingyu (Max) Joo, Assistant Professor of Marketing, University of California-Riverside, Riverside, CA Inyoung Chae Jx Alex J Kim Mobile ad spends in the U.S. have drastically increased from $1.6B in 2011 to $288.1B in 2021, and are projected to surpass $400B in 2024. Large mobile platforms, such as Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google, constantly promote their geographically targeted mobile ads as an efficient marketing tool for local businesses. Many small businesses have limited marketing resources and budget, and rely on the local foot traffic. Therefore, geo-targeted mobile advertising may selectively attract relevant prospective consumers who live or work nearby at lower ad costs. Despite the rapid growth, there is little guidance for small business owners on whether geo-targeted mobile ads actually lift their mobile and web traffic, and how the ad effects vary by business categories (e.g., restaurants and hair saloons), store reputations (i.e., franchise vs. independent), and distances from target locations. To answer these questions, this paper investigates a large-scale field study of geo-targeted mobile ads conducted from July 2019 to December 2020 in Seoul, South Korea, a megacity covering an area of 146K acres with nearly 10 billion population.
