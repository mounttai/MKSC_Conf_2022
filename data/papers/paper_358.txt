2 - Bullet Chatting as a Double-edged Sword Xinyu Cao, NYU Stern, New York, NY Zuo-Jun Max Shen Bullet chatting (also called Danmaku or bullet curtain) is a combination of video and synchronous messaging and considered to create a sense of community for the viewers. It originates from Japan and is adopted by more and more video platforms, but there is still debate about whether bullet chats enhance viewing experience and how it affects people’s viewing behavior. We try to tackle this question utilizing a field experiment on a major short-video platform. The field experiment allows a randomly selected group of users to send bullet chats in an easier way. The treatment increases users’ tendency to send bullet chats. We make use of this experiment design to construct an instrument variable for the number of bullet chats in a video. Using this IV, we causally estimate the impact of bullet chats on viewers’ viewing and interacting behavior. We find that more bullet chats make viewers more likely to continue watching the video but less  likely to interact---they become less likely to like the video or share the video. We further decompose the effect of typical bullet chat words.
