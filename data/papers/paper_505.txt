5 - The Power of C2C Interactions: How Other Customers’ Responses to Online Reviews Affect Subsequent Customers’ Online Rating Behavior Lu Wang, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China Min Zhang, Li Yiwei, Sun Yuxuan Online reviews have become an important information source for customers to make purchase decisions. However, as the number of reviews increases and fake reviews appear, consumers find it more difficult to sift through useful reviews and distinguish the authenticity of the information. In order to solve these problems and maximize customers’ utility, more and more platforms have been developing their online review systems that make C2C interactions available through other customers’ responses (OCRs). That is, other consumers can respond to existing online reviews after focal consumers post their own consumption experience. OCRs represent a unique touchpoint by which customers interact with each other to get more information, which may also affect subsequent customers due to the public visibility. Therefore, this paper explores whether and how OCRs will affect subsequent customers’ rating behavior. This paper utilizes the review data of 1088 same restaurants on two major online platforms to conduct empirical studies. The fixed model and difference-in-differences (DID) identification strategy are used to estimate the effect of OCRs. The results show that the ratings of restaurants with OCRs significantly increase, and the consistency/inconsistency view of reviews and OCRs also significantly affect the subsequent customers’ rating behavior. The obtained new insights provide a new perspective for the platform design of online review systems and enterprise management reviews.
