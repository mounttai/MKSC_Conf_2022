2 - Bike-sharing Patterns and Utilization Factors: Empirical Study Based in San Francisco Sungha Jang, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA Ian Sinapuelas Bike-sharing is an environment-friendly, affordable, and accessible public transportation mode. Its popularity and contribution to public transportation traffic are growing in many cities. For example, bike-sharing in the San Francisco area accounts for 2% of total public transportation traffic. However, there is no systematic and integrated research on bike-sharing patterns, utilization factors, and optimal marketing strategies. We analyze bike-sharing data in San Francisco to understand the level of bike-sharing utilization in terms of the number of bike trips, bike trip duration, and estimated revenues. We examine the effects of various factors, including unique station characteristics, supply factors, the organizationâ€™s marketing factors, geographic factors, and, most importantly, the number of public transportation mode stops within a distance. Our main findings are that bike-sharing is a substitute for other public transportation modes when bike stations are available within a close distance and a complement to them when bike stations are farther. Other important utilization factors include the number of bike docks, pilot stations, geographic peculiarities such as proximity to tourist sites, uneven topography, and areas with higher retail activities. This research contributes to expanding our understanding of a new growing public transportation mode by specifically demonstrating the effects of the various factors. Based on our findings, managers can develop optimal distribution strategies.
