1 - Untactful Social Media Messages: Consequences and Mitigation Strategies Sourindra Banerjee, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom Abhishek Borah, Andreas Eisingerich, Yu-Ting Lin The positive effects of firms’ active presence and participation in social media has been widely studied in marketing. However, important questions remain about the impact and characteristics of a firm’s self-induced social media crisis that can drive negative sentiment and how the repercussions of such crisis can be mitigated effectively. Specifically, we address this gap in the literature, by theorizing about the phenomenon of untactful social media messages (USMM) and identifying the key characteristics of such messages namely, sloppiness, incongruence, and dissonance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the relationship between the key characteristics of USMM and its damaging effects on abnormal stock returns and point to potential mitigating factors that can help alleviate the negative effects of a firm’s USMM. Specifically, our findings show that incongruent messages trigger not only negative sentiment but also generate negative abnormal returns. While dissonant messages increase negative sentiment, sloppy messages decrease abnormal stock returns. We also show that deletion of the USMM is the simplest and yet most powerful action of mitigation that firms can take to alleviate the harmful impact of USMM. Apologizing and a concurrent strategy of both deletion and apology does not mitigate the tide of negative sentiment sparked off by a USMM.
