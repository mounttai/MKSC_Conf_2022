4 - Does the Content of Managerial Responses to Consumer Reviews Affect Consumer Behavior? Surya Ierokomos, Stanford University, Stanford, CA Sridhar Narayanan, Georgios Zervas Online review platforms such as Yelp and TripAdvisor have seen tremendous usage growth in recent years. Consumers rely on these platforms to provide them information about businesses they are considering in industries such as hospitality, retail, and a variety of service industries. Many of these platforms allow businesses to respond to consumer reviews, and these responses are typically  visible to subsequent visitors to the platform. A nascent literature in marketing has explored the impact of whether businesses respond to consumer reviews on subsequent consumer evaluations. In this paper, we explore the impact of the content of managerial responses to hotel reviews on evaluations by subsequent visitors to the review platform. We develop a unique identification strategy that exploits the quasi-random allocations of responses to respondents in businesses with more than one respondent. We find that, on average, tailored and objective responses with a positive tone lead to higher subsequent star ratings. Furthermore, these more positive reviews tend to focus on service related aspects of the stay, as opposed to the infrastructure or location of the hotel.
