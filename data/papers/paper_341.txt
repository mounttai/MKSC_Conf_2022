1 - Encouraging Donors to Donate in Donation-based Crowdfunding: A Network Representation Learning Approach Jiyeon Hong, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI Qing Liu Improvement in donor retention is one key aspect for nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to sustain their businesses. In our empirical context of this project, its potential impact is further highlighted by the fact that only about 30% of all donors make more than one contribution on DonorsChoose. org, a donation-based crowdfunding platform. Economic theory suggests that reducing the non-financial costs of making a contribution should increase donor retention. In this regard, we focus on developing a recommendation tool to help donors quickly identify projects likely to be of their greatest interest. However, the dominance of one-time donors presents a challenge for existing recommendation tools (e.g., user-item collaborative filtering). Such tools generally rely on a long history of user activities to infer user interest for recommendation, but we cannot rely on that rich information in our context. To address this challenge, we leverage advances in Network Representation Learning using the underlying network structure to enrich the available information on donorsâ€™ interests. Specifically, we leverage autoencoders to incorporate topological relationships  between donors and projects as well as the donor- and project-level attributes. Results from our preliminary substantive analysis reveal different drivers of donation for different donor segments. Based on our findings, we aim to provide managerial insights on how to tailor marketing messages for each segment to achieve a higher donor engagement in the platform.
