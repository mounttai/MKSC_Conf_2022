21- Biased Recommendation with Superior Knowledge under Discrimination Compliance Zibin Xu, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Michelle Lu With superior consumer information, an intermediary platform such as Netflix or Amazon can customize recommendation to facilitate consumer preference learning and product matching. However, these platforms may have biased incentives to steer consumers into accepting recommendations with higher payoffs. This incentive leads to consumer suspicions of the platform’s potential abuse of superior information. In this proposal, we develop a game theoretical model to examine the strategic interactions between an intermediary seller with biased incentives and consumers with noisy prior of intrinsic match values. Our research questions focus on the profit and welfare implications under different compliance policies, which  regard discrimination based on the consumers’ personal information, behavioural data, or intrinsic preference types. Our preliminary results suggest that it may be more profitable for the platform to refrain from using personal data in behavioural targeted recommendations, even though the additional information may improve the accuracy of identifying consumers’ intrinsic match values. In addition, the current data policy that requires the platform to reveal its collected behavioural data to consumers may harm the consumers by reducing the overall relevancy of equilibrium product recommendations.
