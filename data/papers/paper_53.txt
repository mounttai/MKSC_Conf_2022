3 - Response Time in Choice-Based Conjoint: A Non-Parametric Approach Hongjun Ye, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY Zhiya Zuo, Elea McDonnell Feit In a choice-based conjoint study, researchers infer consumers’ preferences for product attributes based on a series of hypothetical product choices. It has been shown that response time for these choices is also informative of consumers’ preferences. However, previous approaches impose strict assumptions on how response time is related to choices and preferences, which may lead to bias in estimates of the preferences. We propose a model for response time and choice that flexibly relates response time to four features of the choice task -- question number, average attractiveness of the alternatives, difference in utility between the alternatives and importance-weighted attribute differences -- using a Gaussian process. We fit the model with data from a conjoint survey, which allows us to visualize the nonlinear multi-dimensional relationship between response time and the four features. We confirm prior findings that response time is related to the utility difference between alternatives and empirically show that response time is associated with the importance-weighted attribute differences between alternatives. The model estimated using response time predicts choice better than one fitted without response time. We discuss how the model can be used to improve conjoint practice and extend our understanding of response time and choice mechanism. Thursday, 10:15–11:15am
