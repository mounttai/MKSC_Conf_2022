3 - Promoting Product Returns: Effects of Price Reductions on Customer Return Behavior Tammo H A Bijmolt, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Christian Friedrich Hirche, Maarten Gijsenberg Online retailers vary product prices over time, in order to influence customer purchase behavior. Problem is, customers might also change their return behavior based on observed and paid prices. Price reductions thereby potentially affect returns both of purchases made during the price reduction and of purchases made before the price reduction but which are still eligible for returning. This study investigates the influence of both at-purchase and post-purchase price reductions on product returns using a unique database of a large European online retailer containing more than 83.7 million purchases and more than 37.5 million returns in over 300 product categories. Results show that both at-purchase and post-purchase price reductions can both foster and lower product returns, depending on prior customer behavior. While both types of price reductions lead to more returns for customers that have returned due to a similar type of price reduction before, they also lead to fewer returns for customers that have not returned due to a price reduction before. We discuss managerial implications based on the result that accounting for the impact of price reductions on product returns helps online retailers to increase their profitability.
