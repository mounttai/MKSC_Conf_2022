3 - Unified Marketing Measurement under Privacy Regulations Nicolas Padilla, London Business School, London, United Kingdom Ryan Dew In the face of increasingly strict privacy laws, digital marketers face unprecedented challenges in measuring the effectiveness of campaigns, particularly at the customer and campaign levels. These new restrictions on customer- level trackability have broken commonplace multi-touch attribution models (MTA), which have become the primary tool by which companies measure effectiveness at the most granular level. While this new environment has made drill-down measurement difficult, it has had a limited impact on the ability of marketers to use classic measurement tools like media mix models (MMM), which have always been built on aggregate measures of campaign spend and performance. In this work, we propose a unified marketing measurement (UMM) framework, rooted in the idea that media mix models and attribution models are both measuring the same estimand: marketing effectiveness. Methodologically, we use a Bayesian framework to jointly model customer-level attribution and aggregate media mix effectiveness through two interrelated components, which are constrained to yield the same insights about campaign effectiveness. This theory-based constraint allows us to identify components of the individual-level model that  would be otherwise difficult. We apply our model using a dataset from a large retailer that includes wide-ranging data about customer activity and campaign performance, including A/B tests, which allow us to validate the performance of the model.
