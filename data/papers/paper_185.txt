3 - Subscription Revenue and Media Content: Evidence rom Youtube Heyu Xiong, Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH Aniket Panjwani A striking trend in the media industry in recent years has been the rise and re-emergence of subscription-based revenue models. Our paper addresses two main questions. First, which creators select into subscription-based business models? Second, what is the causal effect of increased subscription dependence on media content? To answer both questions, we exploit institutional features of YouTube in conjunction with a natural experiment on Patreon, a platform which allows YouTubers to solicit recurring payments directly from their viewers. First, we show that more successful Youtubers were  more likely to become early adopters of Patreon. Second to identify the causal effect of subscription revenue, we utilize the 2015 cyberattack on Patreon as an exogenous shock that drove donors away from the platform and decreased subscription revenue to Youtubers on the platform. We find that this reduction in subscription-earnings leads to a significant increase in the quantity of advertising embedded in media content. While this ‘’see-saw’’ relationship between subscription and advertising revenue is not surprising, we further show that Youtubers are very strategic in how they include advertising. Specifically, the increase in advertising was concentrated in types of advertising that is not easily discernible by their viewers. In contrast, there was no change in less covert forms of advertising on the platform. Altogether, our results suggest that media creators strategically utilize native-advertising to lessen the nuisance cost of advertising and avoid full losses in perceived programming quality.
