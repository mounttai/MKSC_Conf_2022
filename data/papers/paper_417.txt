3 - Sunk Cost in Mhealth Dynamics Yikun Jiang, University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, CA Nathan Yang Our research aims to study the sunk cost fallacy in subscription-based services for mHealth. Using data from a popular Freemium mHealth app, we first provide empirical evidence that premium subscription fees might generate similar effects as the sunk cost fallacy. In particular,  we demonstrate using propensity score matching causal inference that the mHealth users appear to be more engaged in multiple dimensions (e.g., tracking consistency, food and exercise log entries) when they have adopted the premium version (all else held equal). Furthermore, we uncover a novel empirical phenomenon, whereby this inferred sunk cost effect exhibits temporal patterns (i.e., decaying over time).
