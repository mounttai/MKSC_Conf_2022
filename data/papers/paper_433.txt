4 - Ranking Systems and Algorithmic Collusion Liying Qiu, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA Yan Huang, Param Vir Singh  Reinforcement learning (RL) based pricing algorithms have been shown to tacitly collude to set supra-competitive prices in oligopoly models of repeated price competition. We investigate the impact of ranking systems, a common feature of online marketplaces, on algorithmic collusion. Through extensive experiments on a duopoly model where two firms utilize RL algorithms (specifically, Actor Critic) to set prices on a third-party platform that ranks products based on features such as recent sales and current period prices, we find that the introduction of the ranking system mitigates the tacit collusion that stems from RL based pricing. The ranking system’s mitigation effect is moderated by the horizontal differentiation between the products offered by the firms and the stickiness of product ranks. In particular, when products are more horizontally differentiated from each other and when past sales have a larger influence on product ranks (sticky ranking), the prices charged by the two firms are higher and the ranking system’s mitigation effect is weaker. However, in both cases, prices in the presence of ranking are lower than that in the absence of ranking. Our analysis sheds light on the impact of ranking systems on consumer welfare and on design of ranking systems to prevent algorithmic pricing collusion.
