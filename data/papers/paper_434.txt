3 - Fending Off Critics of Platform Power: Doing Well by Doing Good? Kitty Wang, University of Houston, Houston, TX Hemant K Bhargava, Luna Zhang Many digital platforms have accrued enormous power and scale, leveraging cross-side network effects between the sides they connect (e.g., producers and consumers; or creators and viewers). Platforms motivate a diverse spectrum of producers, large and small, to participate by sharing platform revenue with them, predominantly under a linear revenue-sharing scheme with the same commission rate regardless of producer power or size. Under pressure from society, lawsuits, and antitrust investigations, major platforms have announced revenue sharing designs that favor smaller businesses. We develop a model of platform economics, and show that a small-business oriented (SBO) differential revenue sharing design can increase total welfare and outputs on the platform. While the small producers almost always benefit from the shift in revenue sharing design, large producers can also be better off under some conditions. More interestingly, we show that platforms are the most likely winner under a differential revenue sharing scheme. Hence, an intervention that ostensibly offers concessions and generous treatment to producers might well be self-serving for platforms and also good for the entire ecosystem.
