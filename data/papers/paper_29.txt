1 - Why are Firms Different Birger Wernerfelt, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  Cambridge, MA We analyze a model in which two firms invest in stocks of complementary strategic resources. The firms are initially identical and pursue the same strategy. However, since their investments succeed at random times, their stocks will soon differ. Because the strategic resources are complements, the firm with more of them will have stronger incentives to invest and will thus have a better than 50/50 chance of pulling further ahead. The differences between the firms will tend to grow over time and in the limit, they are almost surely different.
