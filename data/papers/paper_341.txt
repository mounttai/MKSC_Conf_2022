1 - Marketing Ability and Product Choice: A Game Theory Approach Chi-Cheng Wu, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan Vu Linh Trang This study demonstrated the impacts of marketing capabilities on the choice of product by businesses through a detailed investigation into the case of Samsung TVs. While OLED panels are significantly appreciated by experts and researchers as a whole new level of technology for TV display (Jia, 2018; Sheedy, Hayes, & Engle, 2003; and Jang, et al., 2019), QLED panels are modestly considered as an advanced version of the classic LED screen. Despite numerous predictions from experts along with the public, Samsung had been unexpectedly determined with its decision of making QLED TVs as its major TV offerings. This research approached and analyzed this decision of Samsung vis a game theory model. The results showed that Samsung with its competitive Marketing capabilities compared to LG would benefit the most when producing QLED TVs despite the less competent technology that this panel type possesses compared OLED TVs. Samsung in this case could obtain benefits from its significant product differentiation and effective Marketing ability. From the theoretical view, the outcome of this study has confirmed the findings of a number of previous researches and studies on the role that marketing capabilities play as a driver of an organization’s performance. The study’s outcomes have first fortified what has been suggested by Makdok (1998) or Masaaki Kotabe and Aulakh (2002) that enterprises could enjoy privileges from its customers through owning capabilities. In this case, even though Samsung is using a technology that is less superior compared to what used by its rivals, it is still a market leader by being able to reach an optimal level of marketing efficiency.
