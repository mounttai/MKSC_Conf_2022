1 - Is Social Media Seeded with Polarizing News? Hema Yoganarasimhan, University of Washington, Seattle, WA Social media plays an important role in news consumption. We examine if and how the content of articles that users seed on social media (specifically, Facebook) differs from those sent through other electronic communications such as email. We use data from the New York Times Most Emailed and Most Shared on Facebook lists for a 2.5 year period to examine this question. We perform an LDA analysis of the corpus of articles in the two lists, and recover the top 40 topics represented in these articles. We find that the topics in the articles seeded on social media are systematically different from those emailed. Articles on topics such as Books, Animals, Food, Real-estate, Nature, and Research are more commonly sent through email. In contrast, articles on more polarizing topics such as Politicians (Donald Trump, Joe Biden), Election investigation, Vaccine, Russia, Womenâ€™s rights, Pandemic, Police etc., are more likely to be posted on social media. Our results suggest that while recommendation systems used by social platforms have been blamed for promoting polarized news, the problem starts with the  content/topics being seeded into social media platforms being systematically different from the general distribution of news available or shared elsewhere. Our research highlights the role of individual users in the polarization of news content on social media platforms.
