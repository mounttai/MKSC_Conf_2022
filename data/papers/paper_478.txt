2 - Effects of Mobile Adoption on Two-sided Online Platforms Performance: A Case of Modern Indian Art Auction Harish Reddy Singi Reddy, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  Mayukh Dass, Piyush Kumar With the digitization of the marketplace, many marketing exchanges are now being supported by two-sided online platforms. These platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and so on provide an efficient and effective place for buyers and sellers to exchange goods and services. As these two-sided platforms have been in business for decades, they have been evolving both in terms of functionality and features in coordination with the development of innovative technology. In this paper, we examine the effects of mobile bidding features on revenue generation and bidder behavior on a two-sided online auction platform that sells Modern Indian Art. Using bidding data from 2000-2021 on sales of 10,772 Modern Indian Art items, we explore two research questions: (1) how offering mobile bidding feature impact revenue for the auction house, and (2) how do mobile bidding change bidder behavior in terms of bidding volume, bidding speed, and bidding amount, and bidder competition. Results show significant effects of mobile technology adoption on platform performance and bidder behavior. The paper concludes with suggestions for auction house managers on how to adjust their product offering to maximize their revenue.
