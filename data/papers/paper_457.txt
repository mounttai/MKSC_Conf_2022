2 - Biosimilar Entry and the Pricing of Biologic Drugs Luca Maini, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC Unlike small-molecule drugs, biologics cannot be exactly replicated and instead face post-exclusivity competition from inexact copies called biosimilars. Under a stylized model, greater perceived differences between incumbent and entrant can cause incumbents to fight rather than acquiesce. Consistent with this prediction, we find that biologics respond to biosimilar entry in the U.S. market by reducing net-of- rebate prices to maintain volume, in contrast to the well- documented response of small-molecule drugs to generic entry. We exploit variation in biosimilar entry mechanisms created by the 2009 Biologics Price and Competition Act to provide further suggestive evidence that perceived differences drive the observed outcomes.
