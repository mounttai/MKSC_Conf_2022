3 - Token Incentives and Platform Competition: A Tale of Two Swaps Xiaofeng Liu, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA Wei Chen, Kevin Zhu For each two-sided platform, how to grow in the competition with other platforms is an essential question. In this paper, we study impacts of token incentives, an alternative incentive approach, in the competition of two decentralized exchange  platforms. Decentralized exchanges rely on liquidity providers to supply liquidity that facilitates the exchange transactions from the demand side, which makes the amount of liquidity supply the key to platform success. The entrant platform, Sushiswap, launched token incentives to attract liquidity providers from the incumbent, Uniswap, who then also retaliated with its own token incentives. Our empirical analysis shows that Uniswap’s own token incentives attract more liquidity to the platform. Surprisingly, we find that the token incentives from the competitor, Sushiswap, also bring more liquidity to the incumbent. Furthermore, large pools benefit more from this positive spillover. Meanwhile, the incumbent’s token incentives do not seem to have a significant impact on the entrant. For the potential mechanisms, we find that increased liquidity is mainly from the increased number of new liquidity providers, which may be driven by information diffusion and increased awareness from the competitor’s incentives programs. Our results provide important insights and practical guidelines on the design of token incentives in platform competition.
