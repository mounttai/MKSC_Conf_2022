3 - Location-based Market Structure: A Dynamic Analysis of Product Assortment and Consumer Purchase Jia Liu, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Kohei Kawaguchi Market structure analysis aims to provide an understanding of the relationship (e.g., substitution and complementarity) among brands/products/services within a market so that practitioners can develop effective competitive strategies and create sustainable competitive advantages. Despite a large number of studies in this research area, practitioners are still in a great lack of guidance for customizing their assortment across multiple stores. This project aims to fill in this significant research gap by identifying different consumer segments and by quantifying the differences in their product and location preferences. To this end, we develop a machine learning model, called the dual Gamma-Poisson Dynamic System (dGPDS), that enables location-based product-level market structure analysis, using panel data on product assortment and individual consumersâ€™ purchases across stores. The outputs from dGPDS can help retailers improve store location strategies as well as location-based product assortment strategies. We apply dPGDS in retail vending because vendors often increase coverage and product variety by installing more vending machines in the same marketplace.
