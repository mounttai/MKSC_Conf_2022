2 - How Does Country-product Association Affect Choice? Evidence from the Restaurant Industry During COVID-19 Minjee Sun, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA Matthew Osborne, Verina Que, Hyesung Yoo The purpose of this research project is to understand and quantify the different behavioral mechanisms that affect the demand for products associated with foreign countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore whether consumers’ ethnic restaurant choices are negatively correlated with the COVID-19 cases of the restaurant’s country-of-origin, whether branding (foreignness of a restaurant’s name) interacts with the impact of country-of-origin on restaurant choices. We further classify different potential underlying mechanisms associated with the observed consumers’ responses. In addition, during this period, consumers were exposed to a series of polarizing events such as statements by political leaders or movements related to racism that could have triggered either positive or negative sentiments towards certain countries. We seek to disentangle health-related risk perception from other behavioral mechanisms such as political animosity or racism that are not directly related to health. We propose to test our hypotheses and explore mechanisms using a mixed-methods approach, combining insights from consumer choice experiments with those from field and media data. Our findings will have important implications for managers and policymakers regarding brand management and the diversity, equity, and inclusion in supporting the entry and stability of minority businesses.
