1 - Seller-initiated Consumer Financing and Consumer Sales-finance Conflicts Chenchen Di, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL Yunchuan Liu  In this paper, we study the conflicts between sales divisions and consumer finance divisions in firms when firms not only sell their products, but also provide financing to consumers. We design a game-theoretical model to study the interdependence and the conflict between the sales division and the consumer finance division within a firm and how intrafirm sales-finance conflicts affect the interfirm competition on both pricing and consumer financing. While conventional wisdom suggests that a centralized structure without divisional conflicts would benefit the firm, we show that in a competitive market, a decentralized firm where the sales and consumer finance divisions make price and financing decisions separately can benefit from the conflicts between the sales and consumer finance divisions and gain more profits than a centralized firm without sales-finance conflicts. In addition, when competing firms can decide their organizational structure endogenously, in contrast to the monopoly market where firms always choose a centralized structure without conflicts, competing firms in a duopoly market, surprisingly, may choose a decentralized structure to strategically invoke the conflicts between the sales and consumer finance divisions.
