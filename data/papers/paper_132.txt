4 - How Well do Outlets’ Early Days Predict Future Performance? Evidence From a Multinational Enterprise’s International Expansion Amrita Mitra, Ivey Business School, London, ON, Canada Kersi Antia Multinational enterprises (MNEs) often rely on local partners to establish new outlets in host countries. Our study provides a better understanding of these outlets’ life cycles. Specifically, we seek to (i) ascertain the critical outlet transition points of takeoff (i.e. transition between the introductory and growth phases) and slowdown (i.e. transition between the growth and maturity phases), (ii) predict the outlet’s sales in maturity as a function of its sales during its introductory phase, and (iii) emphasize the role of the host country-specific initial business environment to explain differences in how well outlets’ sales in the introductory phase predict their sales in maturity. We use monthly sales performance data from a Canadian MNE for more than 400 outlets operated by nearly 300 local partners across 7 countries between 2003 and 2020. We integrate this data with additional information from six different databases for the same countries and over the same 18-year period on more than 100 indicators of host country-specific culture, economic freedom, ease of doing business, and political stability. We rely on Functional Data  Analysis to capture the outlets’ introductory phase sales trends as functional principal component scores (FPCs). FPCs are predictors of outlets’ sales in maturity; their interactions with host-country specific indicators represent the moderating role of the initial business environment. In predicting outlet sales well in advance, our study would help managers’ resource allocation and life cycle management efforts. Our study will also help both parties understand key factors impacting future performance, thus providing them with effective levers of control.
