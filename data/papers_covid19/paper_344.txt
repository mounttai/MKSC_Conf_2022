1 - The Effect of Misinformation on Healthcare Consumption: Evidence from Prescription Claims Ivan Belov, PhD Student, USC Marshall School of Business, Los Angeles, CA Dinesh Puranam The rapid spread of misinformation, disinformation, and fake news is a major challenge for modern society. Misinformation in the health sector is especially problematic as it potentially (1) imposes an additional financial burden on individuals and healthcare systems, (2) harms individuals taking unproven drugs, and (3) places the community at risk both in the short term and the long term. Consequently, we examine the effect of misinformation on healthcare consumption. Specifically, we ask a) how does a misinformation event affect short and medium-term healthcare consumption? b) are some demographic groups more susceptible to misinformation? c) is the institutional response from agencies like the FDA effective in mitigating the effects of such a misinformation event? and d) how does the spread of misinformation via word of mouth influence healthcare consumption? We exploit an announcement by President Trump regarding an unproven treatment for Covid-19 - Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We identify the effect of this announcement on HCQ claims by using prescription claims for other non-Covid drugs as controls. Using Bayesian Synthetic Controls and VAR models, we find evidence that misinformation events have a short- lived impact, institutional responses can mitigate subsequent announcements favoring HCQ, and increased word-of-mouth engagement need not translate to increased HCQ claims. We discuss implications for policymakers, firms, and regulators.  Keywords: Quasi-experiment, healthcare, misinformation, trump, hydroxychloroquine, word of mouth
