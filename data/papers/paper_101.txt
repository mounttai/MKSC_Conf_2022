2 - Firms’ Engagement with Stakeholders During a Crisis And its Impact on Firm Outcomes: Evidence from Social Media Communications Eunhee (Emily) Ko, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL Yoo Na Youm The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to firms. With the high uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, sharing and transmission of information became critical - in the setting of the workplace, rapid sharing of a firm’s stance in responding to the crisis was critical. Among the many unexplored questions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in lines with a call for a deeper understanding of firms’ strategic choices under crisis, we explore firms’ engagement with stakeholders with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine the questions in the context of firms on the S&P 500 list and the strategic choices they make in communicating with stakeholders on social media (Twitter). Specifically, in looking at the role of trust in effective stakeholder engagement, we explore organizational responsiveness, connectedness of stakeholders, the contents (text and images) and underlying emotions of tweets as multidimensions of trust. We use big data and machine learning to compile and carry out content analysis and categorization of the text and images of tweets, followed by econometric models to test our hypotheses. We seek to make three contributions. First, we theoretically extend the essentials of strategic and pragmatic components of stakeholder engagement by incorporating multidimensions of trust and through an inclusive approach to stakeholders. Second, by exploring the context of firm-stakeholder engagement on social media, we provide a novel way to effectively measure stakeholder engagement, addressing the lack of validated measurements of the construct. Finally, by  examining the questions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we address the call for a deeper understanding of firms’ strategic choices under crisis.
