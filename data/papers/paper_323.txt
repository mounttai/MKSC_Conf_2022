3 - Antecedents and Consequences of Wish Listing: Empirical Evidence from an E-commerce Platform K Pallavi Jha, PhD Candidate, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA Ivy Dang  Consumer decision journey has evolved due to the advancement of digital technology. To facilitate consumer’s shopping journey, many e-commerce sites have developed the wishlist function, where consumers can search products and add them to wishlists before finally purchasing or eliminating a product. Though important, very few prior works have studied wishlists in detail. Leveraging a rich clickstream dataset from an e-commerce platform in Asia, we try to understand the antecedents and consequences of wishlisting: Why do consumers add products to wishlists? Which session and consumer characteristic influence wishlist addition? And does wishlist addition have an impact on purchase? Our objective is to explore the consumer’s decision funnel of wishlisting. In the first stage, we examine the impact of session and consumer characteristics on wishlist addition. In the second stage, we examine the influence of wishlist addition on purchase. We also hope to connect our findings with consumer consideration set formation process. This study will extend our understanding of online consumer decision journey by examining the wishlisting process in detail. Lastly, we will derive managerial implications of wishlisting for e-commerce platforms.
