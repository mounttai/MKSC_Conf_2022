2 - Managing and Mitigating Sociopolitical Firm Risk Events Chen Jing, Doctoral Candidate, Boston University, Boston, MA , Dokyun Lee Jx Shuba Srinivasan, Susan Fournier Firms are increasingly concerned with mitigating the negative effects of risk events, with a focus on maximizing positive outcomes for profits, firm stakeholder relationships, and firm value. Risk management becomes especially salient when the companyâ€™s brand connects to trending sociopolitical issues through campaigns intended to garner cultural resonance or through unanticipated consumer activism. Firms with the best intentions can clash with social norms and expectations, resulting in harmful risk outcomes. This research provides marketers with a deeper understanding of the impact of sociopolitical firm risk events and offers guidance regarding strategies to mitigate their negative consequences. First, the authors build machine learning models by leveraging the Natural Language Processing (NLP) method BERT to label and extract public opinion for sociopolitical firm risk events. Then, the authors use synthetic control method to examine the impact of sociopolitical firm risk events and different company mitigating strategies on three outcomes: (1) sentiment of public opinion relating to sociopolitical firm risk events; (2) sentiment of public opinion for the focal firm; and (3) firm value, as measured by stock performance.
