4 - Designing Inclusive Platforms Michael Luca, Harvard Business School, Boston, MA Abhay Aneja, Oren Reshef Online platforms have come to play a central role in the economy, helping to facilitate a large share of economic activity. In this paper, we explore the impact of a feature on a large online platform that allows users to observe the race/ ethnicity of minority-owned businesses. In principle, revealing private user information, such as race, has the potential to either contribute to inclusivity or exacerbate discrimination on the platform. Empirically, we find that the addition of this feature substantially increased demand for minority-owned businesses on the platform. We provide suggestive evidence that the effects are larger in predominately white, higher income, and democratic-leaning areas; and that the increase in demand is driven mostly by non-minority users. Overall, our results highlight consumer preferences for supporting minority owned businesses, and suggest that platforms can in some cases increase demand for minority owned businesses by making the ethnicity of minority owners more salient.
