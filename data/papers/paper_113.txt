1 - How Does a Sales Agent’s Network Structure Impact Her Sales Performance? Evidence from a Multilevel Marketing Firm Sung Joo Kim, Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN Wreetabrata Kar, Sivaramakrishnan Siddarth Multilevel Marketing firms (e.g. Mary Kay) play an important role in many economies but have been understudied in the academic marketing literature. In this research we attempt to empirically identify how sales agents respond  to compensation structure in a setting in which agents can influence sales performance in different ways: personal consumption, sales to customers, and sales from downline sales agents. We analyze sales data for 39201 agents over 2 years from a large multilevel marketing firm in the US. Our reduced form analysis shows that agents put more effort around bonus boundaries in order to achieve higher commission rates. We also propose and estimate a structural econometric model of agent performance that accommodates the costs and benefits of different sales tactics in order to uncover the heterogenous ways in which agents respond to the different compensation elements and derive implications for the firm’s design of compensation plans.
