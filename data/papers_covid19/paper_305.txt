4 - Leveraging Promotions for Social Good: Insights from COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Daniel Gulti Kebede, PhD student, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN James Reeder Governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations have often relied on marketing techniques to drive compliance of their constituency. For example, the US government has recently pledged to spend $50 million in advertising to promote the HealthCare.gov website. Our study explores a different marketing tool used in public policy that has not been studied, promotions. While promotions, both price and non-price promotions, have long been used by businesses to drive sales, this is a relatively new lever used in public policy at such a scale. During the COVID-19 pandemic, local governmental agencies were forced to grapple with how to increase vaccination rates among the population. Our study is the first to examine if the use of promotions increased the rates of vaccinations within the . Using a novel set of data, recasting the bass diffusion framework, and leveraging new techniques to assess treatment effects in panel data we estimate not only the direct effect of promotions on vaccination, but if regional heterogeneity plays a role in its efficacy. Our preliminary findings suggest that the use of promotions does increase the rate at which people get vaccinated. However, this effect is moderated by the size of the population that is vaccine hesitant and political affiliation.
