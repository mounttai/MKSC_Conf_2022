2 - Toward a More Data-driven Product Design: An Integrated Machine Learning Approach Zijing Hu, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX Venkatesh Shankar To attract new customers and retain old customers, firms need to make key product design decisions about which features to include in the goods and services they offer to customers. As products are becoming increasingly complex, firms face challenges in deciding which product features to include or/and improve using readily available structured and unstructured data. To assist managers in making these decisions, we address the following research questions: (1) How can we extract the different dimensions of consumer preferences and product features from structured and unstructured data on consumer evaluation of product purchases? and (2) What product features contribute most to market share? We propose an integrative machine learning approach that uses data on product ratings and reviews. We use neural collaborative filtering, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, and convolutional neural network to extract the latent factors and consumer attention links from product ratings and reviews at Amazon. We then link the latent factors to purchase through a market response model. These interpretable factors and the results from the market response model combine to provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between product features and market share. Our research contributes to the literature in important ways. First, we extend the research on product design, collaborative filtering, deep learning, and natural language processing by developing an integrative analysis of structured and unstructured data. Second, our approach helps managers develop better product designs by identifying the salient product features. Third, we offer a scalable and readily implementable data-driven approach to product design based on easily accessible data.
