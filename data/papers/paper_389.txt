2 - Adoption of Mobile Self-checkout in a Retail Store Aashish Pandey, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR Dinesh K Gauri, Yu Ma, Rupinder Jindal Retailers are incorporating different technologies in their stores to make the shopping experience enjoyable and reduce friction. One such technology - mobile checkout is increasingly becoming popular among retailers. In mobile checkout, consumers scan items while they shop from their phone using the retailerâ€™s app and check out quickly without unloading-loading their cart. We study different shopping characteristics and user characteristics to explain the trial and repeat usage of mobile checkout using store transaction data from a major US retailer. We found that transaction characteristics such as total spending, item price, basket share of groceries, electronics, and consumer characteristics such as prior usage of self-checkout, time pressure, tenure, and trial frequency are significant predictors of trial and repeat mobile checkout usage. We further identify three natural groups of customers who try and adopt mobile checkout differently. Our findings have profound implications for how retailers can enhance the customer shopping experience through optimal allocation of resources to serve different segments of customers.
