2 - Network Effects and Imperfect Competitor Information Paul Parker, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS This paper investigates how uncertainty about the size of competitor networks affects firms’ pricing decisions. In network industries, consumers making purchase decisions oftentimes consider the number of direct contacts that have already purchased the product. In the telecommunications industry, for example, a consumer would be more inclined to choose the carrier already adopted by family and friends. When making pricing decisions firms must therefore consider a prospective customer’s connections to its own network and the connections to rival firms’ networks. However, firms face uncertainty in that the exact number of connections to a rival network is often unknown. Using a dynamic duopoly model of price competition, this paper finds that under mild uncertainty firms price aggressively to tip the market in their favor, after which they price high. Under high uncertainty, firms settle into an equilibrium where prices are low. This has the effect of decreasing market concentration and decreasing average prices.
