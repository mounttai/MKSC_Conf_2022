2 - The Effect of Default Privacy Choices on Consumer Welfare Tesary Lin, Boston University, Cambridge, MA Are revealed preferences the true preferences for privacy when consumers’ privacy valuations are influenced by the default frame? Should policymakers ask companies to seek consumers’ informed consent for data processing under an opt-in, opt-out, or forced-choice frame? We seek to answer these questions using a large-scale online experiment that solicit revealed preferences for consumers’ social media data under different decision frames. The experiment quantifies the degree to which each default interface distorts privacy choices and saves limited cognitive resources relative to a forced-choice scenario. We compare the net effect of these two forces on consumer welfare and discuss their implications on regulating privacy consent interfaces.
