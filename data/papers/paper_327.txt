3 - Marketing and Experimentation for Behavioral Change: Adapting to Drought in California Kristina Brecko, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY Wesley Hartmann This project examines whether smart technology products can shift behavior of those unmotivated by a social objective. In the context of drought in California, we implement a field experiment to evaluate the drivers of adoption of such products and measure their effectiveness in altering water usage. In conservation settings, the biggest opportunities for change can reside with those consumers who place a high value on use of the resource and/or face high costs of reducing their consumption of the resource. Smart technology products have the ability to conserve resources while addressing both concerns; e.g., in our context, they can improve the health of the landscape while efficiently using water. Evaluation of this type of program is complex and not well addressed with traditional RCTs that apply a non-scalable level of treatment on a self-selected population. Compliance will be low, since the solution is for a potentially narrow yet difficult to target segment. To address these challenges, we frame the compliance problem as a marketing problem. We design a sequence of experiments that (i) test drivers of adoption and (ii) use those learnings to promote wide-scale adoption to evaluate effectiveness of the product on the treated population. We find that scaling adoption of an IOT irrigation controller involves a mix of price incentives and installation services. This allows us to evaluate impacts on the efficiency of irrigation.
