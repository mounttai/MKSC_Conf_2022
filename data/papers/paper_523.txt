17- Sponsored Advertising Bid Management Tools in Online Marketplace Wenxiao Yang, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL Yunchuan Liu In this paper, we investigate the strategic role of bid management tools provided by platforms in online marketplaces. Bid management tools (for example, broad match, automatic and flexible bidding) are provided by platforms to help advertisers bid for sponsored advertising slots. Previous research has focused on the role of these tools in reducing advertisers’ management costs and varying advertisers’ bids; tools with lower accuracy than advertisers’ self-management accuracy are typically provided to increase profits in search engines. However, the effects of these tools change in online marketplaces. We develop a game-theoretical model of a platform and two competing sellers. Despite the roles studied previously, bid management tools can also help match sellers with their target consumers, benefiting both sellers and the platform. In contrast to previous research, tools with higher accuracy than advertisers’ self-management accuracy can be provided in some situations. Since the platform generates revenue through sponsored advertising’s auction payments and sales commissions on products sold by sellers, higher tool accuracy can increase profit by higher commission but lower auction payment. Surprisingly, we find that a higher commission rate doesn’t always correspond to higher optimal tool accuracy. In some cases, the platform with a lower commission rate would set higher tool accuracy because of the effect of attracting sellers into auctions.
