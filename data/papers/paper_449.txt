3 - Reputation Burning: Analyzing the Impact of Brand Sponsorship on Social Influencers Mengjie Cheng, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA Shunyuan Zhang The growth of the influencer marketing industry warrants an empirical examination of the effect of posting sponsored videos on an influencer’s reputation. We collect a novel dataset of 85,669 user-generated YouTube videos created by 861 prominent English-speaking influencers in the beauty and style category. We extract a rich set of theory-driven features and use DiNardo-Fortin-Lemieux reweighting to construct comparable treatment and control groups that are matched at the influencer-video level. A difference-in-differences analysis on the matched sample finds a reputation-burning effect: a sponsored video, compared to an equivalent organic video, costs the influencer 0.17% of their reputation (operationalized as the number of subscribers). The reputation-burning effect is stronger among influencers with larger audiences; an analysis of likes and comments reveals a larger gap in the audience’s response to sponsored vs. organic videos among influencers with larger (vs. smaller) audiences. The reputation- burning effect is mitigated when there is high fit between the sponsored content and the influencer’s usual content and when the promoted brand is less well-known. Our study empirically tests an assumption of several theoretical works,  contributes to the literature on influencer marketing and celebrity endorsements, and provides managerial implications for influencers, brands, and social media platforms.
