1 - Estimation of Sequential Search Model with Search Set Membership Jae Hyen Chung, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong I propose a methodology to estimate the sequential search model without the consumer search order. For the estimation of the sequential search model, the search order has been considered to be an integral part to recover the parameters of interest, including preference parameters and the search cost parameters. However, often, datasets that show the order of searches may not be available to researchers, making it impossible to estimate the model without making additional assumptions about the search orders. To overcome such restrictions, I propose a method to estimate the sequential search model by adopting the expectation-maximization algorithm. I present a simulation study to demonstrate the parameter recovery of the proposed method and compare other methods that can be used in cases with the similar data availability.
