2 - Modeling Reference Dependence Effect and Regulatory Orientation I Hsuan S Chiu, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI Gary J Russell One major implication of the value function in prospect theory is loss aversion: losses loom larger than gains of the same size. The empirical examinations of loss aversion from consumer brand choice decisions, however, provide mixed results. For example, Bell and Lattin (2002) show that loss aversion is reduced or disappears when taking into account consumer heterogeneity. In this research, we show that regulatory focus theory can account for the heterogeneity in the reference dependent effect: consumers in a promotion- oriented mindset show a weaker response to loss aversion comparing to those in a prevention-oriented mindset. We consider a decision context where consumers rely on external reference points. To capture the reference dependence effect, we use the random regret minimization (RRM) model developed by Chorus (2012). The RRM model describes a decision process that compares attributes of an alternative to that of all other alternatives in the consideration set. RRM allows for flexibility in evaluating reference dependence effects across all attributes and alternatives, and provides a framework for incorporating regulatory orientations into the model specification. Using data from a choice experiment, we demonstrate that prospect theory describes the within-individual differences with respect to losses and gains, while regulatory focus theory describes the between- individual differences.
