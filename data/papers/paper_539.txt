2 - Monitoring Disintermediation in Peer-to- peer Markets Yingkang Xie, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL Jingyi Wang, Huaiyu Zhu Disintermediation is a challenge for two-sided markets: trading partners who find each other on a platform can coordinate offline to cut out the middleman, resulting in missing data and revenue leakage for the platform. Both practitioners and researchers need good detection methods to uncover the extent of disintermediation and its causes. We demonstrate how to use text, geolocation, and fee experiments to identify disintermediation using novel data from an on-demand logistics platform. Cheaters may face a higher cost of covering up their tracks than hiding their intentions with words. Tracing drivers’ GPS footprints near the shipping addresses of canceled trips can recover almost 95% of disintermediated transactions. In contrast, the standard industry practice of scanning conversations between trading partners recalls only half of the cases. While text data provides rich information about cheaters’ motivations, firms that rely only on text mining could significantly underestimate their revenue leakage and thus fail to make informed decisions on pricing and product design. We further validate the GPS measurement using the behavioral changes triggered by an experimental variation in commission fees. Our work provides strategies for platforms to check whether they become showrooms for search and matching when minimum advertised pricing (MAP) monitoring and enforcement is not possible in peer-to-peer markets.
