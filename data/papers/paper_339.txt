3 - From Sale Descriptions to Perceived Warmth and Competence of Providers Hamid Shirdastian, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada Michel Laroche Building on the speech act theory, we examined how sale descriptions have an impact on consumersâ€™ social cognitions of service providers and how they could be used to generate new content. Previous studies only focused on general linguistic characteristics. However, we added to the social cognition literature by examining the combination of warmth and competence in an in-field observation of user-generated content in the sharing economy context. The dataset contained 398,926 reviews for 11,678 Airbnb  properties, located in a North American city (from August 2010 to November 2021). We measured how different types of service providers (amateurs vs. professionals) and certain concreteness levels (abstract vs. concrete) change the perceived warmth and competence of the service providers. Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we analyzed the guest reviews and the property descriptions and found lower perceived warmth and competence for amateur hosts as well as higher social cognition from more concrete descriptions. Moreover, we discovered that in abstract descriptions, amateurs used a more positive sentiment description than professionals. Not only did the results suggest that higher positive listing sentiment led to more positive social cognition but also it fully meditated the effects of listing concreteness on social cognition. The findings showed the role of linguistic concreteness and sentiment analysis on both social cognition dimensions for service providers. The research not only contributes to more easily incorporating linguistic theories in marketing but also advances the literature in terms of understanding how textual communications influence user perceptions. It could also help develop more accurate Natural language generation (NLG) algorithms to communicate.
