1 - How has the COVID-19 Changed the Online Knowledge-sharing Behaviors via Remote Working: Evidence from Stack Overflow Jihoon Hong, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ Mengxia Zhang The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected how people work and communicate. As many employees start to work from home, they have been facing difficulties sharing and acquiring information with colleagues. Online knowledge-sharing platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow) may provide a solution to this rapidly changing environment, as employees may alternatively choose to exchange information on such platforms when working remotely. Thus, we study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on usersâ€™ entry and contribution behavior on online knowledge-sharing platforms.  We collect 3,842,184 questions and 4,328,060 answers posted by 1,661,308 users on Stack Overflow, the largest online knowledge-sharing platform, from September 2018 to September 2020. We use a difference-in-differences model to leverage the exogenous pandemic shock. We find that after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) the quantity of the total contributions (questions and answers) increases, but the average quality of them decreases; (ii) the contribution per user and new user entry significantly go up, leading to the result (i); (iii) female users have larger membership growth and ask more questions while providing higher quality answers, compared to male users; and (iv) the results (i) and (ii) become more salient in the regions where the workplace closure is ordered or where the number of workplace visits decreases. We discuss implications for online knowledge- sharing platforms and the firms adopting remote work in the post-COVID era.
