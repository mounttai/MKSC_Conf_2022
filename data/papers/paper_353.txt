1 - When Beings Bargain with Bots Sumon Chaudhuri, ESSEC Business School, Cergy, France Arnaud De Bruyn Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of many business operations. Activities that were once thought to be exclusive to human beings are being successfully automated using AI, resulting in greater efficiency and profits. Automated CRM, adaptive FAQs, and chatbots are some examples that immediately spring to mind. An avenue that has recently garnered attention in the AI community is negotiation, with firms like RoboNegotiator gaining prominence. Given these recent developments it is crucial to understand how human beings behave when they negotiate with an AI, instead of humans, in practical scenarios. To address this question, we have developed an AI bot using supervised deep learning to replicate the behaviour of human beings in bargaining games, and simulate their behaviours in dynamic simulations. We will demonstrate a research framework to study such interactions realistically and show how it is possible to build AI agents that negotiate like humans. We then show how these agents can be trained to build super AI that beat human beings at their own game. Finally, we conclude by laying out a research agenda on human exploitability by AI and why this topic needs more academic attention moving forward.
