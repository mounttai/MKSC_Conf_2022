3 - Welfare Impacts of Subscriptions for Digital Goods: The Case of Video Games Carol Lu, Stanford University, Stanford, CA Jacob LaRiviere Offering content via bundle-based subscription services has become a prevalent business strategy for media platforms. Despite its popularity, there is limited empirical evidence on whether the subscription model could generate better outcomes for consumers compared to the traditional a la carte selling model. We answer this question using a novel proprietary dataset from the Xbox video game platform. We develop and estimate a model of demand and supply for individual games and the subscription service Game Pass. Applying the estimates, we find consumer surplus increases by 16% on average when Game Pass is introduced. The decomposition analysis shows that 47% of this surplus increase comes from the bundling aspect of the subscription service, and the rest comes from its renting aspect. We further simulate a scenario where consumers cannot purchase any games and can only access them through a subscription service. Consumer surplus decreases by 38% compared to the traditional selling model, with low-intensity and focused consumers being most affected. However, offering multiple tiers of subscriptions that cater to different segments of consumers could generate similar welfare outcomes as the selling model.
