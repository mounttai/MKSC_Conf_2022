2 - Discovering Product Gaps in the Market Alex Burnap, Yale University, New Haven, CT , John R Hauser Successful firms develop products that meet consumer demand, are feasible to produce, and sell at a premium over costs. Marketing science has a long history of identifying product gaps, usually in perceptual space, that lead to the greatest revenue (and sometimes profit). We build on this history using extensive data available in the automotive industry, in which we combine optimization methods with  a deep learning model to search a high-dimensional space to generate new product concepts that balance demand (more is better), engineering feasibility (must be able to be built), and costs. The demand and engineering models use dual Wasserstein autoencoders to compress high- dimensional data on consumers and products to represent both heterogeneous consumer demand and realistic design feasibility. A search algorithm is used to discover product gaps and, in doing so, generates feasible and profitable new product concepts. We test our approach with empirical data from the US automotive market. The data are based on over one million revealed purchases. Consumers are represented by 900 attributes and feasible automotive designs are represented by 1200 attributes. Preliminary results suggest that it is possible to identify product gaps enabling firms to search for profitable new products.
