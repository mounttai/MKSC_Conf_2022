4 - Health Inequality in Tele-medicine: The Ironic Effect of Video Provisions Jiang Qian, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia Jian Ni, Meng Zhu The distribution and allocation of healthcare resources are important indicators to address health inequalities. Telemedicine through virtual visits, as an alternative to physical office visits, allows patients from regions with scare health resources to access high-quality healthcare. However, patients might face greater uncertainty when selecting a therapist through text-only webpages. The offering of profile videos and AI tools allows therapists to introduce themselves and provide details on their services. In this study, we investigated whether the introduction of videos has an impact on the pricing of teletherapy services. We construct a similarity measure between the therapistâ€™s appearance in the profile images and the profile videos, using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a causal inference framework, we find that the introduction of profile videos could lead to a premium for teletherapy price, and higher similarity between videos and pictures could generate even higher premiums. In other words, while the introduction of profile videos may bring some benefits of reducing patient uncertainty in selecting a therapist online, it could amplify and further jeopardize inequalities in access to healthcare.
