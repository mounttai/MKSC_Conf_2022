2 - The Effect of Ads on Search: An Experimental Approach Ilya Morozov, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL Anna Tuchman We study how display advertisements in online retail affect the way consumers search for products and make purchase decisions. To this end, we design a simulated online book store that imitates the shopping experience of real online book stores. We populate this store with strategically selected books and design it so that consumers can examine the product list, visit product pages, and place orders just like they would normally do when shopping online. We then conduct an incentive-compatible advertising experiment in which we let participants shop in our book store while  randomly exposing some of them to advertising banners of specific books. By monitoring their search activity and documenting final choices, we collect highly detailed consumer search data. Using these search data, we then empirically study whether and how display advertising works by testing several hypotheses that have been put forth in the theoretical consumer search literature.
