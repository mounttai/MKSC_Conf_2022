2 - A Theoretical Model on the Role of Marketing in Strategic Exits of Corporate Venture Capitalists Manaswini Acharya, Research Scholar, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX Mayukh Dass Corporate Venture Capitalists (CVCs) are venture capital divisions of firms that directly invest in new start-ups to fulfill the firm’s goals. As more and more firms are expanding their footprint over the past few decades, CVC investments have seen double-digit growth in the marketplace. However, like other investors, CVCs also frequently exit from their investments. Some of these exits are reactive to the changing market conditions, whereas other exits are proactive where CVCs plan investment exits as a part of the underlying strategy at the time of the investment, and we define them as strategic exits. In this paper, we use the theory-in-use approach and develop a theoretical model that examines the role of marketing in the strategic exit of CVCs. In particular, the paper first identifies the marketing factors related to the four categories, market governance, customer orientation, competitor orientation, and learning orientation, that may affect the strategic exits of the CVCs. Next, using in-depth interviews of fifty CVC’s C-level managers, we identify a theoretical model and present related propositions that examine the propensity of strategic exit of CVCs. The model indicates the direct effect of CVC-venture partnership characteristics and the moderating effect of CVC, venture- specific characteristics, and the external characteristics on the CVCs’ strategic exit decisions. Finally, we validate our model using inputs from a different set of C-level respondents and conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial contributions of the study.
