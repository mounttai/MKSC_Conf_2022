3 - Training Personalization Policies for Large Audiences with Constraints Yuting Zhu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA Haihao Lu, Duncan I Simester Personalization, which aims to target different marketing actions to different customers, has attracted broad attention in both academia and industry. While most research has focused on training personalization policies without constraints, many firms face constraints when training these policies. These constraints can introduce difficult optimization challenges, particularly when the firm intends to implement the policies with large samples of customers. Traditional optimization methods are often unable to overcome these challenges. We show how recent advances in solving large-scale linear programming problems can be applied, and provide theoretical guarantees on both optimality and computation speed. Using a large-scale field experiment, we empirically show the advantages of our methods for different customer sizes, and different types of business constraints.
