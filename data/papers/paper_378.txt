4 - Deep Learning Methods for Customer-based Corporate Valuation: Evidence from 1000 Companies Over 6 Years Kyeongbin Kim, Goizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta, GA Daniel McCarthy, Dokyun Lee A canonical problem within the empirical CRM literature is to predict future customer purchase activity using historical behavioral data, with customer-based corporate valuation (CBCV) generalizing this problem across behaviors and customers to revenue at the overall company level. Common wisdom within these literature streams is that modern machine learning methods may outperform traditional parametric models at the individual-level over short forecasting horizons, but lack interpretability and underperform at the aggregate level, especially over longer  horizons, making such methods unsuitable for these use cases. Using a novel credit card panel dataset for 1,000 companies over a 6-year period, we show that common wisdom had indeed been true historically. However, through a one-of-a-kind meta-analysis, we show that a subset of time series deep learning methods, when optimized for CRM settings, robustly outperform extant models in CBCV settings assuming only internal data (for inside-out analyses) or external data (for outside-in analyses) are available, over short and long time horizons. We also show that the proposed method predicts company-disclosed revenue data better than Wall Street analysts, further establishing its value in CBCV settings.
