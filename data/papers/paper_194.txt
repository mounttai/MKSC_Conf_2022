1 - Negative Imagery Framing for Advertising Climate Change on Social Media Shuge Li, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Jun Bum Kwon, Huy Pham Quang, Felix Septianto, Pradeep Chintagunta  While climate change is a significant problem in the world, communicating climate change issues has been challenging because the nature of the issue is abstract, complex, and slow-moving, thus hindering environmental nonprofit organizations (NPO) from engaging their audience. The current research examines how negative imagery framing in NPO advertising increases viewer engagement on social media. By detecting visual theme about climate change issues and classifying it into negative and positive framing in each 1,537 Greenpeace Australia Pacific Instagram posts, this research shows that negative framing increases social media engagement (i.e., the number of likes and comments). A follow-up experiment also suggests that present focus drives the framing effect. Moreover, this research also shows that warmer, more saturated, and brighter colors enhance the aforementioned effect. As such, findings of the present research contribute to the literature on climate change communication, emotional content on social media, and color psychology, and further provide concrete and feasible implications for NPO to promote societal issues such as climate change.
