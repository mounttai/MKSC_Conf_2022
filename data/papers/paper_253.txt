3 - Online Content Paywall Configurations: A Randomized Field Experiment Lucas Stich, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, München, Germany Robert Rußell, Benedikt Berger, Martin Spann, Thomas Hess Digitalization has exacerbated the monetization of news content, such that insufficient digital advertising revenues have pushed news publishers to introduce digital paywalls and freemium models to monetize their digital content, restricting free content offerings in terms of either choice (premium paywall) or quantity (metered paywall). However, the effectiveness of digital paywall configurations and their potential interactions remains uncertain, particularly with regard to converting free users into paying subscribers. Leveraging user-level activity data from a field experiment with more than 19.8 million anonymous users at a large U.S. news website, this research measures the effects of a new metered paywall, added to an existing premium paywall, on  users’ conversion, consumption, and retention behaviors. Among users consuming enough content to be affected by the metered paywall, the introduction of the paywall resulted in a significant decrease in the number of website visits and article views, but increased the likelihood of conversion. Furthermore, comparing the retention rates of subscribers across experimental groups suggests variation in the shares of subscribers retained after two months. These results have relevant implications for media companies seeking to design an optimal digital paywall configuration.
