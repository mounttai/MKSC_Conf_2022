4 - Digital Engagement with Luxury Brands on Social Media: An Experimental Study Christina Giakoumaki, DEREE-The American College of  Greece, Athens, Greece Areti Krepapa The purpose of this research is to determine drivers of digital engagement with luxury brands on social media. Engagement is a key metric for social media marketing and has attracted considerable attention in the literature and more so in the research area of luxury brand digital marketing. In particular, recent research on digital engagement suggests that individuals with greater tendency to incorporate brands into their self-concept are more likely to engage with luxury brand social media posts. This study is based but also considerably extends the relevant literature by modelling the relationships among Brand Engagement in Self Concept (BESC) and Digital Engagement (DE) with luxury brand social media posts. More specifically, we develop and test a model in which the Self- Brand Connection (SBC), i.e. the extent to which consumers integrate a specific brand into their self-concept, mediates the relationship between BESC and DE and that this indirect effect is further moderated by the type of source posting the social media content. Our model is tested in empirical data from a between-subjects experimental design. The results reveal how SBC fully mediates the relationship between BESC and DE and demonstrate that social media post source moderates not only the direct effect between SBC and DE but also the indirect effect of BESC on DE through SBC. Our findings yield original and actionable insights for luxury brand social media marketing. It is demonstrated that SBC is a key factor in building digital engagement and that social media users engage more with posts from marketer-controlled sources (brand, influencer) than with posts made by individual users. The findings have specific practical implications for the design and implementation of social media campaigns by luxury brand marketers.
