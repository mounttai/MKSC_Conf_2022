4 - Public Private Product Design Yogesh V Joshi, University of Maryland, College Park, MD Shubhranshu Singh Certain consumption contexts involve the design of products which can be fairly resource intensive to produce. In such contexts, it is common to observe public institutions such as governments make substantial investments required for designing products that improve social welfare. In these  environments, it is also not uncommon to observe the presence of private institutions that leverage these substantial investments in order to design products that generate profits. We model such public-private interactions and analyze the implications of these interactions on product design in such consumption contexts. We find that the presence of private institutions does not always lead to enhancements in product quality. There exist market conditions under which the public and private entities co-exist to enable better product designs that lead to higher social welfare. However, public- private interactions in product design are not always socially beneficial: we also find that under certain constraints, the presence of a private institution can lead to product designs that reduce welfare.
