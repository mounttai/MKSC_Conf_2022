3 - How Well does your Movie Competes with Piracy? Modeling and Minimizing Piracy Loss Mingxi Yang, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL Brianna Paulich Digital piracy is responsible for a loss of at least $29.2 billion each year, giving the public more chances to pirate. This study explores the negative financial impact of digital piracy on films, incorporating competing distribution channels (box office and video-on-demand rental sales). This study proposes a financial loss function in the context of digital piracy competing with multiple legal distribution channels, adding a new approach of modeling the potential financial loss due to piracy to existing literature. Furthermore, this is one of the first to address the issue of minimizing the piracy loss function in an empirical setting. The loss function model is applicable to movies with traditional ways of being released (i.e., theatrical release first), but also to movies that are released only online, and movies released in both theaters and online at the same time. We posit that movies that are released first in the theaters (theatrical release first) will have less loss to piracy than movies that are released simultaneously (simultaneous release) in theaters and online. Simultaneous-released movies will have less loss to piracy than movies that are released only online (online release only), especially in the first weeks upon release. This phenomenon of relatively less loss for theatrical- release-first and simultaneous-released movies diminishes as time progresses. The majority of the total piracy loss of movies occurs in the first three to four months after their first release. Moreover, movies that are deemed family-friendly, such as kidsâ€™ fiction movies, are expected to have a higher piracy loss in the winter season than the other seasons. This research provides managerial implications for studios with various distribution strategies.
