1 - The Power of Nature: Exposure to Nature Increases Consumers’ Waiting Patience Sunxu Xu, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China Ying Ding Despite the ubiquitous presence of waiting in consumption situations, little research attention has been given to the environmental factors that might influence consumers’ waiting patience. In the current research, we aim to investigate the influence of exposure to nature on consumers’ waiting patience when the chosen alternative is temporarily unavailable. Building on the extant literature, we propose that exposure to nature can increase consumers’ feeling of relaxation when confronted with waiting, which allows them to shift their attention away from the passage of time. Consequently, the waiting time seems to pass quickly and consumers will exhibit greater waiting patience. We first  run a field experiment to demonstrate that exposure to nature can lead consumers to wait longer for the chosen alternative and have a higher willingness to wait (Study 1, N = 214). Study 2 (N = 204) explores the underlying process and the results show that the proposed effect is sequentially mediated by relaxation and the estimated speed of waiting time passage. Moreover, we explore the moderating role of perceived future time limitation in Study 3 (N = 360). As predicted, for consumers with a low perceived future time limitation, exposure to nature can significantly increase their waiting patience; however, the effect of exposure to nature is mitigated for consumers with a high perceived future time limitation. Our findings advance the existing research by introducing exposure to nature as a novel environmental factor of waiting patience. Managerially, to increase consumers’ waiting patience, marketers can add natural elements to the marketing environments, for example, pot plants and nature sounds.
