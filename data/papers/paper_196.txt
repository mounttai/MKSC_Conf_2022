3 - The Impact of Personality on Social Media Engagement: The Case of Snapchat Sumiran Satyal, Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, IL Edmund Hershberger, Michael Hair This paper attempts to understand the relationship between various personality traits and Snapchat use. A survey was conducted among 265 undergraduate students. Measured variables included the so-called Five Factor Model (McRae and John 1992), which includes Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience. These were measured using the Ten Item Personality Inventory (Gosling, Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003) We also measures Narcisim using the 16 point Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) (Ames, Rose, & Anderson, 2006). Dependent variables included measures of respondentsâ€™ likelihood to engage in various social media related behaviors. We found that Extraversion, and Narcissism were positively related to engagement behaviors, while Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience were negatively related to engagement behaviors. Respondents who were high on Extraversion displayed the greater use of Snapchat and its features. Respondents who were high on Narcissism were more likely to expand their Snapchat use and interact with people other than their friends. Respondents high on Conscientiousness limited themselves to communicating with friends and peers. Respondents who were high on Openness to Experience had lower levels of engagement overall.
