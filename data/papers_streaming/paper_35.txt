3 - Information Provision by Video Influencers: Do Twitch Streamers Bring Viewers into Gaming? Yufeng Huang, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY Ilya Morozov Influencer marketing has grown into a giant multi-billion- dollar industry. Yet, there has been little empirical work trying to estimate how influencer promotions affect the demand of products that they promote. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of influencer marketing in the video game industry. We construct a novel high-frequency dataset on video game streaming by continuously monitoring Twitch. tv, the largest gaming platform in the world, for half a year. We first estimate how broadcasts of popular Twitch streamers influence the short-term popularity of the broadcasted games. Although streamers strategically choose which games to stream, the exact times when they start and end their streams may vary from day to day for reasons unrelated to game popularity. Leveraging this plausibly exogenous within-day variation, we estimate the causal effect of Twitch streaming on the number of people playing the broadcasted game. Our results suggest that Twitch streams bring a substantial number of players into games, although the strong initial effect dissipates within 10 hours after the stream. Using a generalized random forest model, we estimate heterogeneous streaming effects as a function of observable game characteristics. Our results show that streaming has the largest effects on games from unknown developers and games with horizontal characteristics, on which consumer tastes differ, suggesting that Twitch streams convey information about the broadcasted game.
