1 - Unveiling Consumer Preference from Real-time Search Traces using a Bayesian Dynamic Approach Zhiying Hu, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA Xiaojing Dong Making inferences about consumer preferences has been instrumental in targeting and personalized recommendations. Traditional methods have relied on access to historical consumer level data. Such data become less available given the rise of regulatory privacy protections. In this study, we develop a Bayesian dynamic approach to unveil consumer preferences by leveraging their real-time search traces. This approach opens a window for firms to improve consumer search experience and recommendation at an early search stage with minimal information burden, without tapping into the privacy-sensitive data, such as the historical purchase data. To achieve that, we build a Bayesian model to capture real-time information and evaluate individual level price- quality tradeoff in a dynamic manner. Using a utility form that tailors to price and quality tradeoff, we offer a closed-form solution, which enables transparent understanding of how important factors in the process together shape consumer search decisions. We test the model performance in a controlled simulation and a real-world dataset from a large travel website using Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Both simulated and real-world applications of this new approach demonstrate powerful prediction advantages, indicating that firms can effectively discover consumer preferences leveraging the real-time search data.
