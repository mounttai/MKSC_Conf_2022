2 - Diversity in Advertising in Times of Racial Unrest Oded Netzer, Columbia University, New York, NY Jochen Hartmann, Rachel Zalta Firms often attempt to reflect age, gender, and/or racial diversity in their promotional material. At the same time, recent social movements such as BlackLivesMatter (BLM) or MeToo have raised the awareness of social inequalities and biases that are omnipresent in our everyday lives. This research investigates racial diversity in U.S. advertising both in terms of supply—how diverse are the ads presented to consumers, and in terms of demand—how do consumers react to diverse vs. less diverse ads. If diverse ads lead to favorable consumer reaction, this could lead to a win- win opportunity that could accelerate the representation of minorities in advertising. We further explore how the diversity in advertising has changed around the BLM protests surrounding the murder of George Floyd. To explore the diversity in advertising, we obtained a unique longitudinal dataset covering tens of thousands of display ads with hundreds of billions of impressions. We use robust, state-of- the-art machine learning methods to understand diversity compositions on these ads.Between January 2019 and July 2021, we observe an overall positive trend in terms of including minority models in digital ads (esp. Black models) as well as in terms of consumers’ response to ads that feature Black models (in terms of click-through rates). The murder of George Floyd in May 2020, which has caused a global wave of  protests about racial inequality, is associated with a temporary increase of the inclusion of Black models in advertising and more positive reaction of consumers to ads with Black models. However, both these effects levelled off quickly. Overall, our results suggest social movements like BLM can spill over to advertising, enabling a win-win strategy that may help expedite diversity in advertising.
