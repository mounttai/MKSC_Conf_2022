3 - Effectiveness of Micro Ads on Television Beth Fossen, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Philip Kim, Inyoung Chae Television advertisers and networks are showing increased interest in micro television ads, ads that are 10 seconds or less. Yet, limited research has considered micro ads on television. We investigate the effectiveness of micro television ads relative to longer ads by exploring the impact of television advertising by ecommerce retailers on traffic and sales on the retailers’ websites following their television ads. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we find that micro television ads spur more traffic - as much as 21% more - to the retailers’ websites post-ad than longer ads, while we do not find strong evidence that their impact on sales significantly differs from that of non-micro ads. Our analyses also reveal several ad characteristics that amplify the effectiveness of micro television ads. We propose three key distinctions about today’s media viewers which may explain why they would react differently to micro versus non-micro ads. We find support that current viewers’ reduced patience for longer ads may explain the effectiveness of micro ads. Our research provides timely insights for advertisers and television networks seeking economical, attractive ad inventory.
