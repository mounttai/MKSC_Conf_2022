2 - Choice Overload with Search Cost and Anticipated Regret: Theoretical Framework and Field Evidence Xiaoyang Long, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI Jiankun Sun, Hengchen Dai, Dennis Zhang As consumers are offered an ever-increasing number of options for almost every purchase decision in online retail, understanding the impact of assortment size on consumer choice decisions---especially on both search and purchase behavior---is critical. Our research speaks to this question by combining theoretical modeling with empirical analyses in an important online retail context: recommender systems. Specifically, via a large-scale field experiment involving 1.6 million consumers on an online retail platform, we causally examine how consumers’ click and purchase behavior changes as the number of products in a recommendation set increases. We document that both the consumers’ likelihood of making a purchase and their likelihood of starting a search (i.e., clicking on any of the products) first increase and then decrease as the number of options increases. We build a stylized two-stage model of consumers’ search and purchase decisions and demonstrate that our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of a model that incorporates consumers’ anticipated regret. We also discuss other proposed mechanisms of the choice overload effect in the literature and whether they can (or cannot) explain  our observed results. Altogether, this work presents real- world experimental evidence for the choice overload effect in the context of online recommender systems and provide prescriptive insights into when and how limiting the number of options may be beneficial to online retailers.
