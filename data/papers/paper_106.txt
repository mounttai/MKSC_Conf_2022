1 - Consumer Targeting and Service Upgrades Jiong Sun, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN , Yingchen Yan  This paper studies dynamic service upgrades when the firm can price discriminate between new and repeat consumers but consumers can choose whether their privacy is revealed. We find that consumer targeting is not always profitable by discovering a U-shaped effect of privacy cost on profitability. Our study also suggests a personalization trap by finding that consumers conceal their privacy when privacy cost is intermediate, which in turn results in service upgrade over- distortion, upward or downward.
