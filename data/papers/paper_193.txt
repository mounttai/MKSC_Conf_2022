1 - The Semblance of Success in Nudging Consumers to Pay Down Credit Card Debt Benedict Guttman-Kenney, PhD Economics Candidate, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL Paul Adams, Stefan Hunt, David Laibson, Neil Stewart We study how consumer responses to a nudge counteract its intended effect to reduce credit card debt. The nudge shrouds the option to automatically pay only the minimum due - automatic minimum payment - and increases the salience of an alternative option - automatic fixed payment - to automatically amortize debt faster. Despite the intervention causing large proximate effects - increasing enrollment to this salient payment option 21 percentage points and reducing the likelihood of paying exactly the minimum by 7 percentage points - it has no distal effects on debt. Results are explained by three offsetting consumer responses: (i) Automatic fixed payment amounts selected often bind at or just above the minimum due; (ii) Automatic payment (autopay) enrollment decreases - increasing missed payments; and (iii) Non-automatic (manual) payments decrease. For a selected subsample, we link liquid savings data to construct a new measure of liquidity constraints - the minimum liquid cash balance over 90 days - and find (i) bunching of minimum liquid balances just above zero (ii) credit card debt repayment is discontinuously lower when minimum liquid balances fall below zero.
