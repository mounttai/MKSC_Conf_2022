2 - Presidential Advertising Campaigns and Hate Crimes Seulmin Yang, PhD candidate, Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN Linli Xu, Jason Chan, Yi Zhu Presidential campaigns are the essential means for candidates to deliver their stance on key political issues, aiming to persuade voters that they deserve their individual votes. In the 2020 election cycle, the total campaign spending by all presidential candidates was over $4 billion, with TV advertising as the major medium. In the current study, we investigate whether the presidential campaigns have broader impacts on society beyond their influence on the voting outcome. Specifically, we use the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections to examine the relationships between presidential advertising spending and the number of hate crimes across 261 counties. The results indicate that presidential advertising campaigns by the democratic candidates have positive relationships with the number of hate crimes under both election cycles. In addition, more hate crimes are associated with counties where the republican party won the election and in states that traditionally support the republican party. Similar patterns are found across different types of hate crimes. These results imply that people, when exposed to ad campaigns by a presidential candidate of the opposing party, may act out or even conduct a crime, which suggests the need to closely monitor the unintended consequence of political campaigns.
