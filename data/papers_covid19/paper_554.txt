4 - Health Insurance and the Dynamics of Patient Decision Making Jong Yeob Kim, NYU Stern School of Business, New York, NY Masakazu Ishihara Jx Vishal Singh An aging population is considered to be a major factor in the rising of medical expenditures. Patients aged over 65 years made up 16% of the population but accounted for 36% of all health care spending in the US [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2016]. This article examines the impact of government insurance expansion for elderly care in the South Korean market. Our research design uses dental insurance expansions for elderly patients in South Korea to examine the patients’ hospital utilization and treatment choices as well as the dynamics of patient decision making. Our study uses two main data sets: a national public health survey and an unique, individual-level prescription data from a large university hospital in South Korea. We exploit the price variation in different forms of treatments (dentures vs. implants) to compare outcomes of patients just below the age threshold with those just meeting the age threshold. We then develop a dynamic structural patient life-cycle model to examine patients’ strategic delays of treatment and adoption of new technology (implants) under different dental insurance policies. Structural parameters are used to conduct a variety of counterfactuals that provide insights on hypothetical government insurance policies and their impact on patient decision making. We further illustrate how the age threshold can be used as an exclusion restriction to estimate discount factors in the dynamic structural model. Drawing on our findings, we discuss the implications of lowering the age threshold in other contexts, such as Medicare expansion. We also provide insights on adding dental benefits to Medicare, which has been recently proposed by the US Congress.
