4 - Can an AI Coach Help You Lose More Weight than a Human Coach? Empirical Evidence from a Mobile Fitness Tracking Application Sridhar Narayanan, Stanford University, Stanford, CA Anuj Kapoor, Puneet Manchanda Artificial intelligence (AI) assisted tools are increasingly being used in health care contexts to provide advice and motivation. But whether AI can be a good or even better substitute for human involvement in these contexts is an open question. We provide empirical evidence to answer this question specifically in the context of fitness tracking mobile applications (apps). In addition to facilitating the tracking of activity and food intake, such apps provide advice and motivation in the form of targeted messages to their consumers, and this can be done through human coaches or an AI coach. An AI coach allows these apps to scale their offerings to a larger number of consumers, are available on demand to consumers, and are potentially more finely targeted by leveraging vast amounts of data. On the other hand, human coaches might be better placed to show empathy, and consumers might also feel more  accountable to humans. We compare human and AI coaches on their effectiveness in helping consumers achieve their weight-loss goals. Our empirical analysis is in the context of a large-scale mobile app that offers consumers different levels of subscription plans with human and AI coaches respectively, and specifically compare adopters of the two kinds of plans on their weight loss and goal achievement. We address the potential self-selection in plans by employing a matching- based approach. We find, for our sample of almost 65000 consumers that human-based plans do better than those in AI-based plans in helping them achieving their goals, but that this differs by consumer characteristics, including age, gender and body mass index (BMI).
