3 - What Makes for a Good Thumbnail? Video Content Summarization into a Single Image Jasmine Yang, Columbia University, New York, NY Oded Netzer Given the unprecedented proliferation of video content available on digital platforms, thumbnails - reduced-size preview images or clips - have become increasingly important in helping consumers navigate through videos during their search process. Conventional wisdom holds that like a book cover or a movie poster, an effective thumbnail should be both attractive and serve as a synthesis or summary of the video content, allowing viewers to decide which video to watch. Despite their importance, little attention has been given in the marketing literature to explore how viewers choose and react to videos based on thumbnails, and consequently what makes for a good thumbnail to summarize and promote videos. In this research, we explore the relationship between the thumbnail of a video (relative to the video content) and viewers’ subsequent video reactions (e.g., views, watch duration, and engagement). We analyze thumbnails from the perspective of image content, aesthetics and emotions using state-of-art text-mining, computer vision and deep learning tools. Based on the extracted features at both the thumbnail and video frame level, we construct a set of measures to study how thumbnails relate to videos, and draw on the expectation-disconfirmation theory to explain viewers’ video reactions based on thumbnails. Our results suggest that, when it comes to videos, clickbait thumbnails may lead to lower engagement and retention of video viewership, and highlight the importance of using content representative frames. We propose optimal thumbnails to use for different video outcomes and emphasize the importance of embracing thumbnails in creators’ promotion workflows for better video engagement.
