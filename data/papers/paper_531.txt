25- Understanding Influencer Advertising - A Machine Learning Approach Hyunsang Son, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM As consumers increasingly relying on peer-to-peer communications, influencer marketing, which uses the influencers- individuals who post to their social media accounts in exchange for compensation (Agrawal, 2016) is also frequently used. For example, 93% of marketers use influencer advertising (Fertik, 2020), and it is expected that the marketing budget for influencer advertising is expected to reach $15 billion by 2022 (Insider Intelligence, 2021). However, despite the exponential usage of these social media influencers, the effects of influencer advertising are still questionable by showing a median engagement rate per post is .08% on Facebook, .98% on Instagram, and .045% on Twitter (Feehan, 2021). Thus, this research aims to understand how different features influence the effectiveness of influencer advertising on Instagram to generate more engagement using cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
