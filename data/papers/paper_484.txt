4 - The Consumption of Serial Media Products and Optimal Release Strategy Clarice Zhao, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Nitin Mehta, Mengze Shi This paper studies the impact of a platformâ€™s product release strategy on the consumption of serialized media content and the ensuing profits. Releasing all the content of a series simultaneously or sequentially can lead to distinctive consumption patterns and different levels of purchases in the long run. We develop a two-stage structural model where consumers decide whether to visit the platform in the first stage and which books/chapters to purchase in the second stage. We estimate the model with data from a leading online publishing platform where writers upload their books chapter- by-chapter over several months. Our estimation results show that a slower release speed, while limiting binge consumption and henceforth lowering short-term consumption (i.e., the binge consumption effect), leads to an increased exploration of other books (i.e., the product exploration effect) through a combination of two mechanisms - the consumers visit  the platform more often and the consumers explore other books due to the constrained availability of the focal books. Our counterfactual analysis explores the performance of alternative release strategies including a hybrid of simultaneous and sequential releases. The results point to the direction that the platform can improve its sales revenue by implementing an optimized hybrid release strategy.
