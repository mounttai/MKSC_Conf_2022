4 - Adoption of Bioengineered Food Boya Xu, Duke University, Durham, NC Tong Guo, Daniel Xu We study the early-stage adoption of impossible meat, a novel food technology that synthesizes meat substitutes by closely simulating the texture, flavor, and appearance of real meat. Unlike traditional veggie meat that targets vegans and vegetarians, impossible meat attempts to attract meat lovers with minimal taste differentiation. How would this apparently artificial food product gain its success while the market demands less bio-engineered and more organic food? We document the early-stage adoption pattern of impossible meat by overcoming the common challenges in understanding adoption of bio-engineered food: 1) the new technology usually does not reach consumers before  first being adopted by intermediaries, for whom the data is often hard to obtain; 2) the documentation of the marketing antecedent of adoption decisions is incomplete and endogenous, making it hard to causally identify the driving factors behind the technology adoption. Focusing on the key players in their US market debut between 2015-2019, we construct a novel location-specific adoption metric that accurately measures the decisions of local intermediaries. To explain the adoption pattern, we analyze a comprehensive set of media corpus using Natural Language Processing. We find that local news focusing on knowledge sharing and financing of the new technology positively increases the regional adoption of impossible meat, whereas consumer WOM has little impact. We further propose the potential mechanisms for the success of the technology.
