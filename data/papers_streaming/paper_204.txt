1 - Effectiveness of Influencer Marketing for Political Campaigns Philip Kim, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN  Beth Fossen Social media influencers have gained a significant foothold in digital marketing with their capacity to affect consumers. This influence has attracted the attention of political campaigns, which have begun utilizing partnerships with social media influencers with the hopes of impacting voter preferences. At a time when traditional digital ads for political campaigns are facing restrictions on many crucial platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, influencer marketing activity has emerged as an attractive digital advertising option for political candidates. These factors have led to a recent rapid growth of interest in and use of influencer marketing in political campaigns. Given the novelty and meteoric rise of influencer marketing in the political landscape, little is known whether and how much this marketing activity is effective in impacting voters in the political context. In this research, we investigate how sponsored influencer activities by political campaigns impact voter preference, measured through daily polls on political candidates. Furthermore, we examine which characteristics of influencer marketing activity are most crucial in affecting voter preferences and social media engagement. Our analyses utilize data of Twitter posts made by influencers and daily polls of voter preferences for the 2020 U.S. Democratic Party presidential primary candidates from July 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.
