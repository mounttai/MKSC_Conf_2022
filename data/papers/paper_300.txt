3 - Transfer Learning for Personalized Marketing Promotions Artem Timoshenko, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL Marat Ibragimov, Duncan I Simester, Jonathan Parker, Antoinette Schoar Targeting policies are typically trained using data from field experiments. For example, a luxury fashion retailer can decide which customers should receive a coupon for the Valentineâ€™s Day event using experimental data from a similar campaign implemented in the previous year. We demonstrate that firms can substantially improve targeting policies by augmenting the focal experiment with information from other marketing campaigns, even though the source campaigns may involve different marketing actions and different types of customers.
