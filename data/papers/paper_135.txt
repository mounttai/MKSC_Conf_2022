2 - Can Privacy Protection be Profitable Gilian Ponte, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Tom Boot, Thomas Reutterer, Jaap Wieringa Marketing’s motivation to spend every dollar efficiently has resulted in the large-scale collection of personal information fueling an unprecedented detailed level of targeting. Such practices are experienced by customers as intrusive and give rise to privacy concerns—making policymakers and firms grapple with consumers’ privacy protection (e.g. Digital Services Act). Research has shown that existing privacy protection approaches are ineffective in protecting consumers’ privacy. In this study, we propose a methodology that allows marketers to collect personal information and target consumers with a mathematical definition of privacy protection: differential privacy. Importantly, we aim to quantify the effect of differential privacy on privacy concerns, the willingness to disclose information and the profitability of marketing campaigns. Our findings aim to inform public privacy policy, managers and the scientific community. If differential privacy alleviates the intrusiveness that targeting invokes, firms can protect individuals’ privacy while possibly  increasing targeting’s profitability. Conversely, policymakers might consider to mandate differential privacy and protect consumers’ privacy.
