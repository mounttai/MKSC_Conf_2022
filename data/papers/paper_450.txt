4 - Targeting Digital Ads on Emotional Context Hortense Fong, Yale School of Management, New Haven, CT Vineet Kumar, Ravi Dhar An increasing number of firms are expanding ad targeting services beyond demographic and behavioral variables to contextual variables and in particular emotion. We focus on emotion targeting as an ad targeting strategy given that emotion is known to be one of the most fundamental determinants of human behavior. We ask whether matching ad emotion with context emotion—the emotion elicited by the content where an ad is placed—is an effective ad targeting strategy, as has been suggested in past research, and focus on the emotions of happiness and sadness. In contrast to extant research, we consider the self-selection of emotional content in determining ad effectiveness. In a field study on YouTube, we find that while happy ads are significantly more effective in happy contexts than sad contexts, sad ads exhibit no benefit to matching on context emotion. We quantify the effect of ad-context emotion matching and the effect of content self-selection using a lab experiment. The selection effect overwhelms the emotion matching effect. The results suggest that the benefit of ad targeting on emotion stems from finding individuals who are more receptive to ads based on context emotion.
