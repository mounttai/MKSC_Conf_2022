1 - Should We Use Net Scores? Investigating Positive-negative Asymmetries in Brand Buzz, Quality, and Value William Shibuya, University of Houston, Houston, TX Rex Du The authors present empirical regularities about positive- negative asymmetries in brand metrics, using panel autoregression and multinomial logistic regression to study 1,033 brands tracked for more than six years. Marketers frequently use net scores without accounting for potential differences in weights between the positive and negative sides of a metric. But should we use such net scores? Patterns  from two studies indicate we should weigh positive and negative ratings differently. The first study shows that the impact of changes on the positive side of brand metrics is stronger than changes on the negative side. The pattern is valid for changes in quality, value, and buzz and for their impact on purchase consideration and purchase intent. The second study shows that, for quality and value, the inertia of the positive side is higher than the inertia of the negative side regardless of brand rank. For buzz, the pattern depends on the rank: the inertia of the positive side is higher for lower- ranked brands but lower for higher-ranked brands, compared to the inertia of the negative side. Thus, there are positive- negative asymmetries in brand metrics that need to be accounted for to avoid bias when estimating their effects.
