2 - Value of a Thank You - How Non-profits Get the Most Out of Social Media Peer-to- peer Fundraising Beatrice Martin, WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management, Vallendar, Germany Christian Schlereth Non-profits rely heavily on fundraising to perform their services. Knowing how a fundraising channel works is key for professional fundraisers to distribute their resources accordingly. It is vital to study emerging fundraising channels: social media peer-to-peer (p2p) fundraising is one such channel that has recently gained immense traction. So far, we know little about the levers of a non-profit to boost the fundraising success of this channel. Limited research exists on social media fundraising in general, and while p2p fundraising has been around for a long time, there is barely any research on the topic. Thus, we aim to shed light on the mechanisms behind social media p2p fundraising. On social media, non-profits have only two ways to influence the number of donations they receive via p2p fundraising: First, they can attempt to increase the number of fundraisers started through advertising and call-to-actions. Second, they can try to influence the outcome of a fundraiser once it has been started. There exists a solid base of research for social media advertising. Thus we focus on the second aspect in this paper. The power of saying thank you to donors to retain them has been studied in-depth, but not in the context of p2p fundraising. Thus, we want to explore this question: What impact does saying thank you to the initiator of a social media p2p fundraiser have on its success? We use a set of 3 experiments to investigate different types of thank yous. We find that saying thank you significantly increases the number  of donations to a social media p2p fundraiser. It is best to say thank you right at the start of a fundraiser and that, in this particular case, a picture is not worth more than 1000 words.
