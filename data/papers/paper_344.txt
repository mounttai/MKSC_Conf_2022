4 - Culture of Innovation: A Comprehensive Literature Review using Latent Dirichlet Association Serena Pugliese, Bocconi University, Milan, Italy Verdiana Giannetti, Sourindra Banerjee Firms and countries need to develop a culture where innovation flourishes in order to survive and thrive in today’s ever-changing environment. Against this backdrop, the concept of culture of innovation has long captured the attention of academics and practitioners (Tellis, Prabhu, and Chandy 2009). While research on innovation has been organized into systematic frameworks (Rubera and Kirca 2012), research on culture of innovation has not been organized into such systematic frameworks. Research in this area can be classified into two broad streams: (1) research on the impact of national culture on innovation within a country and (2) research on the impact of organizational culture on innovation within a firm (Tellis et al. 2009). We argue that the concept of culture of innovation is far more nuanced, therefore requiring a deep dive analysis. In order to approach this task as objectively as possible, we use NLP techniques, in parallel with our manual classification, at each step of the literature review process. Although there is no standard NLP ready-to-use method that we can easily reapply for this task, when we focus on the individual steps of a literature review  process, different NLP methods can be applied at each step to assist researchers in identifying the necessary papers and how they are related.
