2 - The Impact of Feedback Touchpoints in the Curated Subscription Box Industry Kihyun Hannah Kim, Rutgers Business School, Newark/ New Brunswick, NJ Nita Umashankar, Thomas Reutterer Curated subscription box services are booming. A key characteristic of these services is their multiple feedback touchpoints to garner continuous reactions and opinions from customers throughout the customer relationship. The customer feedback collected through multiple touchpoints offers box service firms the opportunity to learn about their customer experience and help box services encourage customers to repeatedly agree to receive a box and, upon  doing so, buy the box’s products. We use a unique dataset with customer purchase and feedback touchpoint histories from a national apparel subscription box service to examine the differential effects of feedback touchpoints on customers’ future box order and spending decisions. We find that while soliciting feedback allows firms to learn about customers, the impact of customer feedback on customers’ future purchase decisions is not always positive. Customers’ willingness to provide comments may signal their cocreation efforts, positively affecting purchasing decisions. However, the effects of feedback touchpoints depend on the type, and the timing of feedback solicited. We believe the findings of this research will interest customer experience designers at subscription box service firms.
