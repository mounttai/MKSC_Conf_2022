3 - Mobile Money Penetration in Low Income Countries: The Mediation Effect of Latent Demand and Micro-entrepreneurial Climate Marzieh Yaghini, University of Guelph, Toronto, ON, Canada  , Towhidul Islam, Asish Sood Mobile money, an inclusive innovation, provides a wide variety of benefits to consumers, businesses, and governments, thus a deeper understanding of why market penetrations in low- income countries are higher for such inclusive innovation can yield significant benefits. We explore the multiple mediation role of latent demand and micro-entrepreneurial climate contributing to mobile money market penetration. This analysis indicates underdeveloped financial infrastructure, unmet demand, and informal microentrepreneurial environment as reasons driving higher mobile money penetration in low-income compared to higher-income economic regions. Our dataset encompasses several multinational databases including mobile money market penetration in 77 countries from all economic regions. We use a counterfactual approach to establish causal multiple mediation analysis to empirically test our two hypotheses. We establish the negative mediation effect of latent demand and the positive mediation effect of micro-entrepreneurial climate, on mobile money market penetration in low-income relative to high-income economic regions. We contribute to both theory and practice by providing a deeper understanding of the penetration of inclusive innovations.
