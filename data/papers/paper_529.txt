23- Informational Components of the Social Spread of Digital Content Bruce Dore, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada Marketing research has identified correlates of the spread of digital content but has not yet identified patterns of text meaning that predict this spread with high accuracy. We used machine learning to develop a language-based signature of information sharing, trained on over 3 million messages from social media. Specifically, we apply a technique known as word embeddings to represent the meaning of social media posts. Next, we use these embedding vectors as input variables to a partial least squares model trained to predict sharing counts. This resulted in a linguistic signature of social sharing: a pattern of regression weights across semantic vectors. This signature predicted sharing with substantially higher accuracy than models drawn from prior theory, generalizing across content categories, publishers, and time. Signature expression was not highly predictive of excess message liking or commenting, suggesting that it is not an index of positive evaluation or general engagement, but specific to social transmission. The components of  this signature spanned multiple psychological categories, including negative affect, temporal focus, social perspective, and perceptual processes, with no single category necessary or sufficient for the signature’s overall predictive efficacy. Finally, we show that contextualized, publisher-specific versions of the signature reach even higher accuracy than the generalizable ‘one-size-fits-all’ version, indicating that the content drivers of information sharing vary substantially by context. Overall, this work derives an interpretable text-analytic model of the sharing potential of information, providing a basis for new taxonomies of the content dimensions and social processes that drive the spread of information at scale.
