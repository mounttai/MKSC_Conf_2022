4 - Estimating the Value of Third Party Data to Advertisers Nils Wernerfelt, Meta, Menlo Park, CA A central debate in digital marketing today focuses on the role of third-party data in advertising. Privacy advocates tend to push for greater restriction around such data usage to support consumer protection. At the same time, advertisers view the marginal benefit of this data as extremely high for optimizing and targeting ad delivery. While comparatively more work has been done on the former, there is relatively scant evidence on the latter, a key input to designing optimal policy. The goal of this paper is to shed light on this question via a large-scale experiment with over one million advertisers on Facebook. The experiment utilizes a 3x2 design. First, we take live campaigns that use third-party data and randomly assign a small portion of users to a control group that is not eligible to be exposed to the relevant ads. This lift measurement component allows us to estimate the incremental impact on purchases and new customers of current business-as-usual advertising that utilizes third-party data.Second, we modify an additional small fraction of traffic to reflect two main ways that delivery may be affected by a loss of third-party data: (i) via loss of inputs for optimization algorithms and (ii) via limiting the ability to form look-a-like audiences for targeting purposes. As with the business-as-usual advertising, we use control groups to measure the incremental impact of these two alternative forms of ad delivery. Comparing across the arms allows us to derive a first-order estimate of the change in incremental impact of advertising under a loss of third-party data for a large, representative population of advertisers. We discuss both main effects and heterogeneity, as well as possible policy implications.
