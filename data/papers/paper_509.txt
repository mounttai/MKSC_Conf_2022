2 - A Conceptual Model of Sponsorship Signaling Processes Hsin-Chen Lin, Associate Professor, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada Patrick Bruning The sponsorship literature has applied signaling theory to explain how organizations communicate with consumers and other stakeholders with incomplete information about brands, products, and services. Yet, these applications do not adequately outline an organized typology of sponsorship signals or apply these concepts according to the broader processes outlined in signaling theory. This research specifies these processes, as well as the implications of different signals and signal characteristics. A typology and framework of sponsorship signaling processes is proposed to account for the types of signals sent, signal characteristics, signal reception, market responses, and signal feedback. The conceptual analysis revealed a sponsorship signaling process comprised of (1) a typology of presence, quality, and intention signals that convey diagnostic or symbolic information; (2) signal receptions that differ in valance and magnitude; (3) signal characteristics of observability, commitment, and credibility; (4) market responses; as well as (5) equity, emergent, and viability signaling feedback mechanisms. This paper provides a typology of sponsorship signals as part of a dynamic sponsorship signaling process. The paper also specified important aspects of the signaling process that remain underdeveloped, including sponsorship signal reception, the moderating role signal characteristics have in signal reception, and signaling feedback. The typology and framework should help organize future research on sponsorship signaling as guided by the proposed research agenda, and the model can be used by organizations according to the managerial guidelines offered herein.
