2 - Customer Feedback, Employer Public Recognition, and Migrant Workers’ Well-being: Nudges to Facilitate Social Sustainability Ruhan Liu, Peking University, Beijing, China Wanqing Zhang, Pradeep K. Chintagunta, Jing Xu Migrant workers represent a significant part of the wage- earning population in the world and make remarkable contributions to the global economy. Above 200 million people live outside their home countries. In China, rural migrants contributed about 8.2% to the economic growth of the secondary and tertiary industries. However, many of them encounter difficulties in integrating into the local society and suffer from poor working conditions and job stigmatization. To improve front-line migrant workers’ well- being, we use customer feedback and employer public recognition as nudges to help them better understand their job duties, build up self-esteem through others’ recognition, and derive a sense of meaning and belongingness from their jobs. Empirically, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment among 153 front-line employees (the majority  of them are migrants) from an online household service platform in China. Key findings reveal that employees benefit from customers’ positive feedback in terms of learning engagement, job motivation and ability, psychological well- being, and relationships with their employer. Furthermore, treatment effects are contingent on multiple factors, including employees’ demographics (e.g., age, gender, education), prior job performance, baseline levels of well-being, and their employment relationships before our intervention. In addition, repeated interventions remain effective over time. Overall, our research provides insights into social sustainability, marketing for social impact, and supporting vulnerable workers.
