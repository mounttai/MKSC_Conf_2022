2 - Measuring and Mitigating Disintermediation on Two-sided Platforms: Insights from Airbnb and Location Big Data Jinan Lin, University of California, Irvine, CA Tingting Nian, Natasha Zhang Foutz Two-sided online platforms, such as Airbnb and Freelancer, capture $40 billion onlinemarketplace. Nonetheless, disintermediation, where participants bypass platforms to transactdirectly, has challenged the business model and dwindled the profits of the platforms. Despiteexplicit and implicit mitigation strategies, little is known regarding the extent ofdisintermediation and differential efficacy of various mitigation policies. We present some of the first large-scale empirical evidence of disintermediation, quantify its magnitude, and evaluate the causal impacts of various mitigation policies. Analyses of the Airbnb occupancy data and population-scale individual-level location data, using geo-spatial analytics and other machine learning methods, reveal a 6.5% rate of disintermediation in Austin, TX during  the Summer of 2019. Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analyses, augmented with matching, on four strategies suggest that Instant Bookable, which allows guests to book without requesting hostsâ€™ approval, is most effective, reducing disintermediation by 10%, followed by Airbnb Plus certificate (6%), which requires application fees for on-site property inspections. In contrast, the Superhost badge and information concealment create no impact on reducing disintermediation. Further Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences (DDD) analyses of the heterogeneous treatment effects suggest that, for instance, the impact of Instant Bookable on disintermediation is weaker for the hosts with a preference for long-term leases, whereas stronger for those with more repeated online customers. The findings offer important managerial guidance to platforms regarding their mitigation and innovation strategies.
