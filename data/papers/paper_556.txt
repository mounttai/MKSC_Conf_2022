2 - Two-for-one Conjoint: Bayesian Cross-category Learning for Shared Attribute Categories John McCoy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA Rachele Ciulli, Eric T Bradlow Conjoint analysis is an ubiquitous market research tool used to optimize new product design. As it is normally implemented, each time you wish to understand consumer utilities for a given product category, you run a conjoint study for that category. For example, if you wish to know consumer preferences for frozen yogurt features, you run a conjoint that uses choices between frozen yogurts. In this research, we propose a new conjoint methodology based on transfer learning where the researcher learns about a non-focal product category (e.g. frozen yogurt) by using the results of a conjoint study run on a related category (e.g. ice cream) or a conjoint that uses choices between a product in the focal category and a product in the non-focal category. We demonstrate our approach using three product category pairs (ice cream and frozen yogurt, jackets and bags, and TVs and computer monitors) where categories in a pair have overlapping features. We show how out-of-sample prediction accuracy is improved by using cross-category predictions (in a Bayesian fashion) with both no data and sparse data from the focal category. We demonstrate the effects of cross-category information on managerially relevant decisions.
