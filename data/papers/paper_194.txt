2 - Understanding Why Customers Co-hold Savings and Debt: A Field Experiment Rafael M. Batista, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, IL Neale Mahoney, Jessica Min, Abigail Sussman This project explores co-holding, whereby consumers consistently carry low-yielding savings balances while also holding onto high-interest debt. Through a large-scaled randomized controlled trial (RCT) we sought to test two hypotheses. The first was that consumers were unaware that they were co-holding. Consumers have limited attention and therefore may have overlooked the amount they had available in savings when looking at their credit card balances and deciding what to pay off. The second hypothesis was that even if they were aware that they were jointly holding onto savings and debt, they may not have realized the costs of doing so. 125,328 co-holding customers from a large financial institution were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: one which informed consumers that they were co-holding, another that informed but also made the costs of doing so salient, and a third, control group which received no new information. We find no meaningful difference between the  two treatment groups. We also find no noticeable difference in the amount repaid between those receiving a notification and those in the control group (p = .162). However, those in the treatment conditions paid more post-intervention than they had pre-intervention (p < .001) and were also more likely to pay more than the minimum contracted amount (p < .001). Our results suggest that consumers might be co- holding for reasons which are not a lack of awareness or a misunderstanding of the costs. Since conducting this study, we have surveyed a subset of these same consumers and are currently in the process of linking responses to their banking data in order to conduct further analyses.
