5 - Identity and Economic Incentives Kwabena Donkor, Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, CA This paper theoretically and empirically analyzes how identity (one’s sense of self) affects consumption or investment decisions. We first present a model where identity distorts individuals’ beliefs about uncertain outcomes and imposes psychic costs on identity-incongruent actions. Then, using two large field experiments on soccer betting in the UK and Kenya, we experimentally varied material incentives for betting on matches where soccer fans are neutral or favor one of the teams playing. Finally, we combine the model with respondents’ portfolio allocations across different matches to disentangle biases in investment decisions due to over-optimistic beliefs and those due to the psychic costs from identity-incongruent choices. We find that, on average, respondents misallocate 10% of their investment budget because of their over-optimistic beliefs and misallocate an additional 15% of their budget to avoid psychic costs. Our experimental findings also suggest that the impact of debiasing information campaigns that target biased beliefs is limited in contexts with identity concerns than otherwise.
