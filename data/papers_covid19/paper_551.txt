1 - The Provider Network Selection Problem in Health Insurance Markets Amin Hosseininasab, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Willem-Jan van Hoeve, Sridhar R Tayur Provider network selection is a central problem in health insurance markets. A provider network consists of healthcare providers that are contracted by an insurer to provide healthcare services at discounted prices to its insured patients. The problem involves selecting which providers to contract, how to group contracted providers into insurance plans, and how to price such plans in order to better target and acquire patients. We develop a novel methodology for optimal provider network selection that is theoretically guaranteed to provide an optimal solution. We further show empirically that our approach improves over methods used in the literature, and the strategies used by a real-world insurer in practice. We finally use the developed methodology to analyze the effects and benefits of optimal provider selection on insurer profits, healthcare costs, and social welfare under different data environments.
