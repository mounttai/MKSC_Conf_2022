4 - Cables Instead of Bottles? The Role of Digital Divide in Reducing Crimes Associated Alcohol Consumption Fanruo Wang, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY Weiguang Wang, Fanruo Wang Since various evidence has shown that alcohol is a breeding ground for crime, regulatingalcohol consumption has been a desired but challenging task is society. Historical prohibitionon alcohol supply and consumption resulted in unwanted consequences, which furtherescalated crimes. While studies focus on negative outcomes during regulations, it is unclearwhether retaliatory alcohol consumption would lead to adverse results once regulation is removed. This paper investigates this question by taking a perspective of digital divide. AsInternet has deeply penetrated into our daily life, it becomes addictive with theoretically andbiologically similar mechanisms as alcohol. By leveraging the difference in liquor regulationduring COVID-19 pandemic in Maryland and Pennsylvania, this paper utilizes over 1.6 millionmobile location observations of 6,474 users and combines various data sources. Usinga difference-in-differences model, we confirm an increase in crimes caused by the retaliatoryalcohol consumption. Further, an investigate on the role of Internet use shows surprisingfindings. We find that people with high-speed internet are less likely to resume alcohol purchasesafter reopening, which consequentially reduced the crimes. Further analyses indicatethe substitution between Internet and alcohol is particularly strong in addressing drinkersâ€™ socialexpectancies instead of the expectancies of tension reduction.
