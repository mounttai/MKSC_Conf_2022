3 - A Theory of Customer Search across Multiple Platforms Mohammad Zia, Chapman University, Orange, CA We investigate customer search and purchase behavior across multiple platforms (such as Amazon, Best Buy, or eBay ), each of them hosting several bands. Customers may engage in costly searches within or across platforms to resolve their uncertainty about product prices and match. Some customers are loyal to one platform, while others may cross-search across platforms. We find that when platform loyalty decreases and customers become more willing to search across platforms, equilibrium prices fall, and customer purchases increase. Interestingly, we show that the impact of cross-searching on profits depends on the magnitude of search costs; cross-searching negatively impacts profits if the search cost is low, but it positively impacts profits if the search cost is high. We further examine how platform asymmetries (in terms of customer loyalty or brand quality) impact customer search, brand pricing, and profits.
