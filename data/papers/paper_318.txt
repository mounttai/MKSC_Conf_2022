1 - Implications of State-dependent Play Behavior in Video Gaming: An Individual Level Analysis Bruno Castelo-Branco, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Puneet Manchanda In this paper, we leverage data from a major video game distribution platform to investigate how users decide which games to play and how their choices are intertemporally related. More specifically, the longitudinal data set includes the time users played each game on each day, as well as the purchase of new games, thus allowing us to use a structural approach to investigate how state-dependence influences playersâ€™ consumption leading to behaviors such as addiction and variety-seeking. We discuss how the results can be relevant for the platform, game developers, and policymakers.
