3 - Improving Web Brokerage Model - Building Online Communities for Daily Deal Websites Yiyuan Ava Liu, Otterbein University, Westerville, OH Wanxi Li Coupon-promotion based online brokerage model is applied by daily deal websites. Groupon.com, slickdeals. net, dealmoon.com and hundreds of deals sharing websites have gained great popularity since Andrew Mason introduced the deal-of-the-day concept in 2008. Deal information includes brands, retailers, base prices, deal savings and deal descriptions such as product and service features, exclusive coupons, and deal ending time. Attracting bargain-  hunting customers via price discounts and time-sensitive availability, some deal websites have gained tremendous and stable traffic and shared revenue, while other websites that fail to attract repeated visits disappear gradually in this oversaturated online space. In the current study, we are presenting three sets of empirical studies, in order to, 1) explain the impact of deal sharing website types and designs on brokerage model and referral marketing performances, 2) analyze deal sharing websites and community management in two language text contexts and conclude factors that help engage visitors and shape the positive sentiment through social media or deal sharing communities. We also find significant drivers of user engagement by creating deal sharing community and social media integration, as well as user-generated content (UGC).
