1 - Understanding Consumer Journey Using Online Conversations Lingling Zhang, China Europe International Business, Shanghai, China Wei Shi, Amy Yiping Song Consumerâ€™s shopping journey for healthcare services is increasingly moving online. Because of the high level of quality uncertainty, consumers often need to speak with online customer service agents to acquire more information before they make an appointment with healthcare providers. Therefore, the interaction with agents plays a critical role for the consumer journey outcome. However, little empirical research has systematically examined the effectiveness these conversations in terms of their content and dynamics. In this research, we have an opportunity to work with a leading dental clinic chain in China to observe their consumer journey in a major market for six months. Our data includes the complete footprint of the journey: from which channel the consumer is acquired (i.e., organic visits, search ads, and display ads), the detailed conversation exchanges with online agents, and whether the consumer agreed to make an appointment and perform the dental procedure. We apply machine learning techniques to understand the topic flow of consumer-agent conversations and examine how the conversation dynamics lead to different conversion outcomes. Our results demonstrate how to detect interested consumers in the early stage of online conversation and how the content and dynamics of conversation is associated with the  propensity of conversion. This research has direct managerial implications for healthcare providers to understand and influence online consumer journey through analytics.
