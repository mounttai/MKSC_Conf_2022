1 - Voice Tone as a Driver of Smart Agent Anthropomorphism: Process Paths and Persuasion Consequences Yegyu Han, IE Business School, Madrid, Spain yegyu.han@ie.edu Dipankar Chakravarti Consumers often anthropomorphize non-human objects including robots and smart AI devices like Amazon’s Alexa. Humanoid features, facial expressions. and natural language processing capabilities facilitate such anthropomorphosis imbuing a machine with distinctive, human-like psychological responses (e.g., motivations, emotions, and cognitions) that imply intentionality. A smart agent’s voice and voice tone can also evoke anthropomorphism with corresponding attribution of personality features, autonomy and trustworthiness to the machine. However, the specific pathways along which such effects occur as well as their persuasion consequences are not well understood. Prior research shows that voice tones with a higher average pitch and delivered at faster speeds signal emotionality in interpersonal communication. We examine whether a similar attribution would occur naturally (i.e., replicate) for smart agents (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home). In an experiment with a between-subject design, we show that higher pitch and greater delivery speed not only generate perceptions of emotionality, but also facilitate anthropomorphism. As expected, the anthropomorphic attributions for an emotional versus a rational voice are differentially rooted in affective (warmth and sociability) versus cognitive (competence and intelligence) perceptions. Furthermore, we find that the voice tone effect translates to a higher consumer motivation to engage in consequential communal behaviors that are mediated by affective anthropomorphism.
