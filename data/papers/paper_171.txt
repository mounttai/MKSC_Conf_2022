1 - The Causal Effect of Recommender Systems vs. Best-Seller Lists: Evidence From an A/B Test Shrabastee Banerjee, Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands George Knox In a world of many alternatives, consumers turn to recommender systems (RS) to discover products that match well with their preferences and sellers devote substantial resources into developing them. Yet the causal effect of RS on demand and other outcomes of interest remain hard to study. In this project, we use data from an A/B test conducted by a large e-commerce firm in the Netherlands, which experimented with an item-to-item collaborative filtering  RS, relative to a control condition that used a bestseller list. We use the A/B test as an instrument to identify the effect of clicking on a recommendation on sales, as well as several intermediate steps in the customer journey: products viewed and put in basket. We see no overall effect of the RS on total revenue or purchases, but find a substitution effect: the fraction of purchases that directly result from a RS click or view is higher than that from a best-seller click or view. We also find that the RS drives consumers to view more products within a given session, but leads to less across-session diversity in viewed assortments. Taken together, our results have implications for the design and deployment of recommender systems on e-commerce websites.
