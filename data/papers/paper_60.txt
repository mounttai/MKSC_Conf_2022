3 - Nudging Misperceptions Walter W. Zhang, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, IL Sanjog Misra We propose a framework for welfare analysis of nudges when consumers hold potentially biased beliefs. We estimate a structural model of the influence of nudges on consumer beliefs and purchase decisions in the context of a large food delivery platform. We identify the model by combining panel data on consumer purchasing behavior with variation from a randomized field experiment that nudged consumers to purchase the platform’s subscription service. Consumers make a repeated monthly decision on whether to renew this subscription service whose benefit depends on the consumers’ expected consumption. Consumers hold biased beliefs if they make repeated subscription mistakes from an ex-post perspective. Nudges have a substantial effect on subscriptions as well as 90 day on-platform consumption. However, nudges have an ambiguous effect on consumer welfare as only some consumers are made better off by  purchasing the subscription. We show how policy makers can leverage these heterogeneous treatment effects and the structural model to optimally target nudges in order to maximize consumer or producer surplus.
