3 - Direct and Indirect Profits from Gift Giving: Consumer Learning about Underexplored Alternatives Shi (Sherry) Wang, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH , Ralf Van der Lans Gift giving is an important social activity that generates high profits for retailers and brands. In addition to direct profits, gifts may indirectly affect profits by influencing receivers’ purchase behaviors. First, gifts may substitute receivers’ purchases, reducing the profits from gifts indirectly. Second, gifts may influence receivers’ subsequent purchase behaviors, especially when they are not fully informed about their preferences. In such scenarios, gift consumption provides an opportunity to learn about underexplored alternatives, which may generate additional future profits. This paper empirically investigates these direct and indirect effects of gift giving on profits using a unique panel dataset in which both givers’ and receivers’ purchasing, consumption and gifting behaviors are observed. The authors develop a new dynamic generalized linear model which captures both purchase incidences and choices before and after gift consumption. The results demonstrate that a significant number of gifts lead to a change in receivers’ behaviors, leading on average to indirect profits of about 10 percent of the gift price. Indirect profits are more likely when receivers’ purchase frequency and expected utility of the gift are lower prior to gift consumption, and when givers are more experienced and share similar interests with the receiver.
