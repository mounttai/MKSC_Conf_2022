3 - Machine Learning Based Causal Inference with Multiple A/B Tests on Large-scale Platforms Zikun Ye, UIUC, Urbana, IL Dennis Zhang, Zhiqi Zhang, Heng Zhang, Renyu Zhang We develop a new framework to estimate and infer the overall treatment effect of multiple experiments and identify the optimal experiment combination with partially observable outcomes. We propose a deep learning and semi-parametric statistics framework to estimate the HTE of any experiment combination for each user on the platform.
