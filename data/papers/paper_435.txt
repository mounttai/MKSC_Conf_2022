2 - The Size and Welfare Effect of Trade Allowances: Lessons from Yogurts Yihao Yuan, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA This paper examines how trade allowances affect consumer surplus. Trade allowances—lump sum payments from manufacturers to retail stores—may enable low-quality products to crowd out high-quality ones, which harms consumers (distortion effect). However, they may also allow cost sharing between manufacturers and stores, thus incentivize stores to offer more products (expansion effect). The overall effect of trade allowances on consumer surplus is therefore theoretically ambiguous. To quantify this effect, I estimate the size of trade allowances using a two-stage model, in which stores decide assortments and prices in each stage. In contrast to the prior literature, I utilize stores’ revealed preferences to construct moment inequalities for estimation, which allows me to avoid imposing strong assumptions on the vertical relations between manufacturers and retailers. My estimates imply that trade allowances account for one fifth of the average store’s profit. Counterfactual analyses indicate that eliminating trade allowances would reduce the number of products offered but would still increase consumer surplus overall. This suggests that the costs of distortion outweigh benefits from product expansion.
