1 - Dynamics of Online Creators’ Engagement States and Content Contribution: Evidence from Online Literature Markets Shibo Li, John R. Gibbs Professor of Marketing, Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN Amy Wenxuan Ding Individuals are increasingly becoming creators of user- generated content. However, little is known about such creators’ unobserved engagement states and their dynamic contribution behavior. This paper presents a dynamic structural model with a hidden Markov process to uncover the mechanisms of creators’ content contribution decisions (whether and what to contribute) and their dynamics and consequences. Using online literary markets as the context, we show that a creator often exhibits multiple engagement states over the course of producing one serial product. We find that the impact of various intrinsic and extrinsic incentives on content contribution depends on the content creator’s engagement states. A creator is likely to start in the high engagement state but is more likely to stay longer in the medium state. Over time, a creator’s probability of  remaining in the medium state increases. The cost of content contribution is the highest in the low engagement state and the lowest in the medium state. Significant creator and product heterogeneity exist in the creator’s engagement states and optimal contribution decisions. Our study provides important theoretical and actionable managerial implications for marketing researchers, site managers and average individuals as content creators.
