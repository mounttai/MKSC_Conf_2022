12- The Role of Intertemporal Budget Constraint in Competitive Market for Non-durable Seasonal Goods Shiyu Yang, Tongji University, Shanghai, China Ye Qiu  Recent studies suggest that it is common for consumers, especially Gen Z, to delay purchasing behavior due to revolving credit card debt. Thus, intertemporal budget constraint should be an important factor while modeling consumers purchasing behavior. This study developed a two-period model to investigate the outcome of the price competition between two firms sealing non-durable seasonal goods to strategic consumers. We captured two dimensions of competition: firms competing with its rival and firms competing with its future self. We find out that under certain conditions, competition will be reduced after introducing a rival into the Coase framework. This is because that firms’ responses in the second period induced by price reduction of the focal firm in the first period make consumers prefer to buy its enemy’s product at full price. This leads to a smaller demand increase in the first period of the focal firm compare to what happened in the monopoly case. We also established that the emergence of BNPL (buy now pay later) which relaxes consumers budget constraints can improve the social welfare by reduce the product price and sometimes increase market coverage. Moreover, both firms and consumers benefit from BNPL in equilibrium.
