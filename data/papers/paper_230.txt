4 - Sponsored Content and News Consumption Tradeoffs Adithya Pattabhiramaiah, Georgia Institute of Technology, Smyrna, GA Inyoung Chae Media publishers are increasingly hosting sponsored content (SC), a type of native advertising that resembles editorial information but possesses commercial intent, on their websites. SC has grown increasingly popular for two reasons: first, it typically achieves higher response rates compared to banner ads. Second, SC is routinely co-created by advertisers’ and the publisher’s specialized journalistic groups, which affords publishers better control over the content. However, hosting SC is not free of risks because consumers may mistake SC for editorial content due to their high similarity. This study offers implications for assessing the profitability for publishers from hosting SC. Using rich micro data that track clicks and subsequent consumer engagement with editorial and sponsored content on a news website, the authors demonstrate that SC viewership hurts subsequent consumption of news. Consistent with the view that readers feel misled by SC’s resemblance with editorial content, the negative effect is pronounced when the article headline appears to be editorial, but its content is mostly promotional. Notably, this negative impact of SC on user experience occurs despite its explicitly being labeled as sponsored content, following FTC guidelines. This adverse impact on reader engagement dissipates over subsequent visits and  results in no discernible effect on readers’ subscription and churn tendencies. These findings urge publishers to carefully consider the revenue potential of SC against the potential loss in news traffic and to employ SC headlines that better match readers’ expectations to mitigate such loss.
