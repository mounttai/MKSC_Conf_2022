3 - Pay Now vs. Free Later: Investigating the Impact of a Consumption-decelerating Promotion on a Serialized Digital Media Platform Jangwon Choi, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Inyoung Chae, Fred M Feinberg Promotions for digital goods have typically focused on enticing users to consume more, commit for longer, try more varieties, but above all on acceleration: incenting content consumption immediately or during a tight time window. Here, we investigate the effects of a novel promotion, Wait Until Free (WUF), that is uniquely consumption-decelerating. WUF can be potentially profitable for a variety of reasons, chief among them its application to serialized digital content,  that is, distinct series broken up into successive episodes. Specifically, customers can sample novel content for free, and can continue to do so by waiting a fixed time; or, for those unwilling to wait, by paying. WUF thus exploits heterogeneity in intertemporal substitution utility, but can also entail both spillover (increased, profitable consumption of non-treated series) and a variety of cannibalization artifacts. Analysis of a dataset from an online platform for internet comics suggests that the WUF promotion can in fact boost paid readership for the treated series, and also at the platform level even when cannibalization from other untreated series is accounted for, when applied to the right set of comics. Using a combinatorial genetic algorithm, we efficiently search through sets of series that maximize paid viewership over time windows of different lengths, finding that the genres and popularity of chosen content can change based on planning horizon. Finally, to understand individual user-level substitution effects, we employ a Cox proportional hazards model to identify consumption stickiness for episodes within-series and switching behavior across-series, and how these are affected by the WUF promotion.
