8 - An Analysis of Activating Communication on Website Between Users by the Propensity Score Considering the Heterogeneity of the Questioner Maika Sasaki, University of Tsukuba, Tokyo, Japan Keisuke Ishibashi, Ozaki Koken We analyzed how the reactions of other users to the behavior of one user affect the re-behavior of the same user on an online website, which belongs to C to C interaction. Specifically, using the data from the Question and Answer website for parents raising children, we analyzed what kind of answers to the questions to activate the website would make it easier for the same questioner to ask the next question in a short period of time. The answer to the question is regarded as a treatment, and the effect on the time until the next question is analyzed for each treatment - a quick answer, a good answer and a long sentence answer. By aligning the covariates such as the attributes of the questioner between the treatment group and the control group, we used the propensity score and excluded the effects of differences in covariates from the effects of the treatment. Although the propensity score has the problem that the unobserved covariates could not be balanced, but in this study, by incorporating different random intercepts for each questioner into the propensity score calculation model, we could balance the heterogeneity of unobserved questioners. As a result of the analysis, if the questioner is the first answer to the question and the answer is a good answer, the time until the next question by the same questioner is  shortened. The finding has important implications for firms operating online website that want to better examine how to activate the website.
