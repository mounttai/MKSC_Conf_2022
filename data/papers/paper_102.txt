1 - Contextual Song and Playlist Recommendation: A Bayesian Generative Modeling Approach Khaled Boughanmi, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY Asim Ansari, Yang Li Playlists have become the principal mechanism for music listening since the revolution brought about by digital streaming services. As an example, the Spotify platform alone accounts for more than 4 billion user-curated playlists that are carefully compiled for a variety of musical tastes and consumption contexts. Given the immense heterogeneity in musical tastes and the endless number of playlists that can be constructed, the design, completion, and recommendation of personalized playlists have become critically important. In this paper, we develop a novel Bayesian generative modeling approach to perform these tasks. We identify the musical preferences of online users for diverse musical styles and listening contexts in an unsupervised fashion. Specifically, we leverage Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to uncover latent variables that summarize the musical themes and contextual moods associated with songs and playlists. We fit our model using a rich data set containing playlists that are curated by Spotify users. Our empirical investigation yields interesting insights about the diversity in musical preferences across users and contexts. We leverage the results of our model to cross-recommend curated playlists to users with similar thematic preferences, complete existing playlists with songs of congruent mood and context, and automatically design new playlists for personalized musical experiences.
