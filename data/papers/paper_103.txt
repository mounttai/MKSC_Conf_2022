2 - Learning Customer Heterogeneity from Aggregate-Response Online Experiments Mengyao Huang, University of California Berkeley - Haas School of Business, Berkeley, CA Longxiu Tian  This research seeks to understand how firms should design and utilize online randomized control experiments, or A/B testing, to optimally learn the preference distribution of their customer-base when only aggregate-response test results are available (e.g., total impressions and clicks). To solve this problem, we develop a scalable hierarchical Bayesian (HB) aggregate logit model to identify multivariate distributions of within-test consumer preference heterogeneity, by leveraging between-test variations. We illustrate the proposed method using both simulated studies and a dataset of 32,487 news headline tests (totaling 150,817 variations) from an online media platform. To quantify the design space of headline tests, we decompose textual headlines into latent representations via Transformer networks and provide interpretability via transfer learning of latent features from news headline corpora that have been prelabeled on topics and sentiment. We relate empirical results to dependent variables-of-interest (i.e., within-test click-through rate (CTR) and firm-declared winner) and show how firm decisions would deviate due to not accounting for customer heterogeneity. We find that preference heterogeneity significantly affects selection of optimal aggregate-response A/B tests and discuss the implications of our findings for efficient test design in the news headline setting.
