4 - The Role of AI in Strategic Marketing Decision- making: How Will Managers Collaborate with Smart Machines - Today and Tomorrow? Nina Hesel, Nuremberg Institute for Market Decisions, Nuremberg, Germany Fabian Buder With increasing data availability and computing capacity, companies are intensifying their efforts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to generate business value. Particularly in the area of marketing, there is a great potential for the use of AI. To date, AI applications in marketing practice have focused primarily on automating processes at the operational level and gaining insights from big amounts of data. However, there is a growing expectation in academia that AI has the potential to support, augment, or even replace marketing managers in strategic-level decision-making. Previous studies indicate that managers accept to give algorithms some weight in managerial decisions, but they still want to keep a certain level of control. However, the question how such a human-machine collaboration (HMC) on a strategic level might look like remains largely unanswered. Our study addresses this lack of empirical evidence by examining managers’ acceptance and future preferences regarding the weight and role of AI in strategic marketing decision-making. A five-category model is presented to evaluate the role of AI in collaboration with human managers. Based on its tasks and its level of autonomy, the role of AI can range from “no AI involved” to “Assistant”, “Collaborator”, “Project Manager” and “Manager”. The study examines differences between concrete types of marketing decisions and between specific tasks within decision-making processes. The standardized survey study is based on a sample of 500 high-level executives (C-suite or direct reports) responsible for marketing or corporate strategy from B2C-companies on the Global Forbes 2000 list.(Study currently in field phase, results by begin of may)
