1 - Logging Off: On Consumer Disengagement in Online Grocery Shopping Els Gijsbrechts, Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands Katrijn Gielens For the longest time, grocery ecommerce has been lagging behind. With Covid, an uptick in online grocery adoption is observed. But is do shoppers stick with the channel? Anecdotal evidence indicates that online experiences are not ideal and even after repeated trials, many disengage. An analysis of this issue is currently lacking, and our research fills this gap. Our objectives are as follows. 1. assess the prevalence of online grocery disengagement 2. pinpoint sources of disengagement 3. gauge the impact of Covid 4. uncover segments with different online channel (dis) engagement. Typically, online channels are praised for convenience - saving shopping time and effort. But does the online channel truly increase convenience? For one, online grocery shopping requires shoppers to acquire a new set of habits. Moreover, most shoppers keep buying groceries both online and offline; Online is thus not a substitute but a complement to store visits, implying that online affects offline, and carry-over effects alter shopping convenience. We use a ‘smooth transition’ approach to capture online grocery- shopping propensity as a function of experience, shopping pattern adjustments, and external factors. We combine this model with an online trip-share component as consumers do not shop online every week and use a latent class approach to address consumer heterogeneity. We use data on 10,000 Dutch households between 2015-2021. We find that the majority of online adopters do not stick and distinguish four segments (Dis)engagement follows from a tradeoff between experience, disenchantment, and shopping patterns adjustments. We see that Covid does not ‘jump start’ online grocery: while it tempts shoppers to try the channel, few are converted into permanent users.
