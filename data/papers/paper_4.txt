4 - Competition with Consumer Ratings Tommaso Bondi, Cornell University, New York, NY We study the impact of consumer ratings on duopoly competition. Three features of the model are key. First, firms are strategic: they design their products anticipating the presence of consumer ratings, and dynamically adjust their prices as information about them is revealed (as is the case on platforms like eBay or AirBnB, for instance). Second, ratings can be informative about both product quality and consumers-products fit. Third, consumers can be either strategic or naive in their interpretation of ratings. The presence of ratings introduces novel tradeoffs for sellers, who find themselves optimizing a mix of present sales and future ratings: the two objectives are often at odds, since reaching more consumers today yield worse average ratings tomorrow. This leads firms to increase prices, and thus, consumer welfare need not improve with ratings. A similar result holds for the share of rational types: some naivete can be a blessing in disguise for consumers, as it reduces the unintended consequences of ratings.
