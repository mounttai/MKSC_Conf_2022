3 - Gender Portrayals in Print Advertising: A Longitudinal Content Analysis Edmund Hershberger, Associate Professor, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Edwardsville, IL Michael Hair The portrayal of women in advertising has been a long- studied phenomenon, with the seminal work being completed by Erving Goffman in 1976. This theory postulates that there are six categories of Gender Display in advertising: relative size, feminine touch, function ranking, ritualization of subordination, and licensed withdrawal. This theory has been revisited a number of times (Kang 1997; Bell and Milic 2002; Sharma and Bumb 2021). This study seeks two objectives: 1) to validate the Goffman categories in more current media, and 2) to detect social shifts from the 1960s to the 2010s as displayed through magazine advertisements. Following on established procedures for conducting content analyses  of advertising (Kassarjian 1977), we accessed published magazine advertising from the archive of Time magazine (www.time.com/vault/). A team of researchers accessed issues of Time magazine from each of the last five decades. For each decade, the first full page ad featuring a woman was selected from each month of the first five years of each decade, resulting in a total sample of 360 ads. The ads were split by decade among three coders, with each coder applying the category rubric suggested by Goffman (1976). We found that across most of Goffmanâ€™s categories, use of the portrayal category significantly decreased throughout the period. However, the occurrences of the Infantilized Woman increased significantly throughout the period. Also, occurrences of Feminine Touch and Licensed Withdrawal declined overall throughout the period but increased from the 2000s to the 2010s.
