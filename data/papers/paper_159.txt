3 - Pricing Sustainable Products Siddharth Prusty, Duke University, Durham, NC Wilfred Amaldoss Consumers care about sustainability and the environment, and this growing concern is reflected in their purchase decisions. In response to these shifts in consumer mindset, firms are taking several initiatives to improve the impact of their products on society and environment. However, knowing that investments in sustainability come at a cost, it is a priori unclear whether such investments add to a firm’s profits, especially in the presence of competition. Moreover, how should a firm price a product with a sustainability claim? To explore these questions, we propose a theoretical model for pricing of sustainable products in a horizontally differentiated market. We explore two alternate mechanisms by which investments in sustainability can affect purchase behavior: (1) by increasing consumer valuation for the product, or (2) by increasing consumer demand for the product without influencing valuation. Under both mechanisms, we solve for equilibrium sustainability investment and price. Our model allows for heterogeneity in consumer preferences for sustainability.Our analysis yields some counter-intuitive results. We find conditions under which equilibrium price can be independent of the proportion of consumers valuing sustainability, while firm profits can be decreasing in this measure, due to firms facing a prisoner’s dilemma. We explore how diversity in consumers’ taste affects equilibrium, finding conditions that can lead to both increase or decrease in prices and profits. Finally, we compare equilibrium sustainability investment in a free market as compared to the total welfare maximizing investment level. We see that firms might tend to over-invest in a free market, with both firm profits and consumer surplus as higher in a free market than in a regulated market.
