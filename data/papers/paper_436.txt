2 - B2B Persona Buyer Center Analytics Lili Zhang, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, San Jose, CA Zainab Jamal, Swarup Chandra  B2B typically has long and complex cycles with a purchase decision made by a group of decision makers in the buying center. Identification of people in the buying center and their influence becomes critical for marketing and sales to streamline their efforts. Persona-based marketing is an important way of designing strategies that place the buyer personas at the center to effectively engage the customers, leading to the improvements in click-through rate, conversion rate, and revenue. A persona is a representation of the customersâ€™ characteristics (e.g., demographics, job roles), among which the job roles are more relevant in B2B. In this work, we showcase how we have used data science methods (e.g., unstructured data analytics, natural language processing, topic modeling, supervised learning) to identify core buyer personas from millions of job titles and build the persona influence index based on their engagement and conversion behaviors. The outcome helps evaluate the information value of contact persona groups an organization has and strategically improve data quality to meet the goal of the buying center engagement. It also enables the intelligent persona-based audience creation for marketing campaigns.
