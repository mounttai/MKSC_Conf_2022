1 - The ‘Power Recovery Effect’ of Women- offending Advertising Enav Friedmann, Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel Merav Weiss Sidi Ads that offend women are known to hinder women’s short-term purchase intentions, but their effect on long- term purchase intentions has not been described. Here, using three studies, we examine the effect of such ads on both short- and long-term consumer responses, suggest an explanatory mechanism, and demonstrate how empowering women can buffer this effect. We found that those who felt highly discriminated against on account of their gender group (mostly women) demonstrated a power-recovery motivation toward the brand that offended them, increasing their purchase intentions over time so as to restore their diminished power. Empowering women buffered this effect and decreased purchase intentions, as compared with control ads.
