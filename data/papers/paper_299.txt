1 - Product Innovation Through the Perspective of Design-driven Ecosystem Jesheng Huang, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan Based on the perspective of design-driven ecosystem (DDE) constructed by Huang (2021), this article further explores the types and mechanism of product innovation within this kind of ecosystem, combining the theories of user innovation and user innovators. Derived from the literature review and research findings, DDE is defined as the alignment structure of the multilateral set of entities interacted by their design interdependence in order to provide design-related products with focal value proposition to their common customers, enabled by modularity, not hierarchically managed, which implies the product innovations can be inspired or facilitated  by the related design activity flows among the firms within DDE. Through examining the structures of DDE from three cases—handbook, selfie, and Graffiti, the research finds that, within DDE, (1) he members’ series of out-input combinations in design activity flows provide the key idea sources of product innovation, and most of them facilitates incremental innovations; (2)as customers playing a critical role of value cocreation, most of user innovations are completed by consumers’ sharing their new product idea in the social media platforms, and the type of product innovations vary on materials, new uses, and complementarities with other design among members; (3) user innovators often create new meaning on current product, which can extend or enrich the original value proposition and then bring product conceptual innovations;. Finally, future research agenda has been suggested as well.
