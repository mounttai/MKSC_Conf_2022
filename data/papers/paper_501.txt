3 - Fair Lending in Vehicle Financing: The Impact of CFPB’s Intervention on Dealer Markups and Race Discrimination Cheng He, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI O. Cem Ozturk, Pradeep Chintagunta The opaqueness of the dealer markup practice coupled with a regulatory vacuum has resulted in growing concerns about unfair lending, especially for vulnerable consumers that have less knowledge on the auto loan market or fewer credit options (e.g., minorities or women). The guidance established that the CFPB can hold indirect auto lenders accountable for illegal discriminatory markups by car dealers. Thus, it also encouraged lenders to revise their dealer monitoring and compensation practices to remove dealer discretion to markup buy rates and ensure the compensation mechanism does not result in discrimination. We collect a detailed and unique transaction-level data set between 2012 and 2015 covering three events associated with the CFPB’s intervention: 1) the release of its bulletin in March 2013, 2) the Bureau’s order to Ally to pay for consumer harm in December 2013. We exploit quasi-experimental techniques to examine the impacts of these events on dealer markup decisions. We find that, on average, dealers reduce the markups by 2.5 basis points (bps) in response to the CFPB’s release of the guidance bulletin. Our results also indicate that the enforcement of the bulletin Bureau further amplified this effect, resulting in a decline of 15.2 bps following the enforcement relative to the pre-bulletin period. However, our analyses show that the intervention significantly increased the price premium gap between buyers from African American census tracts and non-African American census tracts. We provide empirical evidence to explain this counterproductive result.
