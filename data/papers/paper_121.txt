1 - Identifying Marketers’ Skills from Self- presentation in Profile Pictures Olga Goncalves, IAE University of Perpignan (MRM), Perpignan, France Camille Lacan Internet Platforms of the sharing economy struggle with identifying the most skilled marketers on their platforms. Current approach uses online consumer ratings as well as marketer’s online activity information to distinguish the most skilled but it requires several months or years before knowing the result. Drawing from the impression formation theory and the evolutionary psychology, this research examines whether marketers’ self-presentation in a profile picture could be an early signal of their skills and turns to the deep learning models on visual information processing to solve this cold start issue. A pre-trained CNN deep learning model (VGG-Face) combined with trained models extract the hidden features of profile pictures from 37,002 Airbnb hosts (balanced between hosts and superhosts). These features are augmented by contextual information and entered into a tenfold cross-validated binary classifier (Logit). Superhost marketers were correctly identified in 63% of cases, better than chance (50%, Cohen’s d = .38). The most predictive elements are the attributes of the marketer’s face (morphology, attractiveness) and demographics (age, gender). Transient features (facial emotions, head poses) and social context (number of persons) improve marginally accuracy. These findings highlight the value of facial recognition to identify marketers’ skills and have practical implications for training and the management of marketers.
