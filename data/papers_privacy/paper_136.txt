4 - Assessing the Effectiveness of Digital Political Fundraising Ads on Facebook: Ad Delivery Algorithm, Impressions, and Ad Content Soogand Alavi, The University of Texas-Dallas, Dallas, TX Ying Xie, Shervin Tehrani Digital political ad spending increased by 16% in the 2020 US presidential election compared to 2016, with a vast majority of this budget being spent on social media ads that solicit political donations. We contribute to the political advertising literature, which prior to this work has only examined voter persuasion ads on TV, by studying the effectiveness of digital fundraising ad copy designs given political advertisers’ targeting strategy. The empirical challenge of this study is the potential bias induced by a non-random targeting practice of Facebook’s proprietary ad delivery algorithm. In other words, the exposed users that create the total impressions that we observe as a researcher or advertiser, are chosen by the algorithm based on how likely they are to engage with a given ad content. Therefore, comparing the final impressions of different ad copies (that target the same population) may not be a fair comparison since the users were not chosen randomly. To address this challenge, we train a random forest model that can predict the impressions of an ad if the ad delivery algorithm had not played a role in choosing the optimal user for ad exposure based on ad content. By studying Biden and Trump’s digital fundraising ads during the presidential election of 2020 using advertising data from Facebook’s Ad Library and donation data from FEC, we find that ad content indeed plays an important role in ad effectiveness: ad elasticity varies depending on the tone, fundraising appeals, and state customization of the ad copy. We also find that without correcting for Facebook’s ad delivery algorithm, elasticities are overestimated which is aligned with the reported bias direction in the literature.
