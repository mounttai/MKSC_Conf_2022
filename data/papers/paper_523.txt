3 - Pacing in Real-time Bidding for Online Display Advertising Ugurcan Dündar, WU Vienna, Vienna, Austria Nadia Abou Nabout, Bernd Skiera  Real-time bidding (RTB) is the main ad-selling mechanism in online display advertising. In RTB, publishers auction off their display ad slots for an incoming ad impression through platforms called ad exchanges. Advertisers bid in these auctions to show their ad to the user visiting the publisher’s site. When setting up RTB campaigns, advertisers need to decide on how to allocate their budget over a day, which they refer to as pacing. In this paper, we analyze the profitability of two pacing heuristics. We benchmark them against profit- maximizing pacing, which, by definition, achieves higher profits than the two pacing heuristics. Yet, advertisers might refrain from using profit-maximizing pacing because it may be difficult to implement and requires accurate prediction of the number of auctions, the winrate as well as clickthrough and conversion rates on an hourly basis. To this end, we conduct two analyses: In a counterfactual analysis, we compare the profitability of these pacing heuristics in three datasets from actual RTB campaigns. Because the forecasting error in this analysis depends on our predictions of the above metrics, we run a simulation study to understand when a specific pacing heuristic performs best by varying the forecasting error on those predictions.
