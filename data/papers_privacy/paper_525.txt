19- Have I Seen You Before? Measuring The Value of Tracking for Digital Advertising Grazia Cecere, Institut Mines-Telecom Business School, Evry, France Sarah Lemaire We investigate the effect of privacy protection rules on targeting efficiency and ad prices. We use a change in Appleâ€™s privacy policy the App Tracking Transparency option, as a natural experiment. Introduced in Spring 2021, this new feature of the iOS 14 aims at providing smartphone users with more control over their data. It requires app developers to request explicit permission to track users beyond the app in use. However, this privacy policy is expected to reduce ad effectiveness on mobile devices. To assess the effect of the policy, we use an original database of estimated Facebook ad performances in the US market. We compare the outcomes of ad campaigns targeting iOS users versus Android users. The results suggest a reduction in targeting efficiency and ad prices for ads aimed at iOS users compared to Android users.
