1 - The Mechanisms of Moral Trade-offs in Life- saving Medical Triage Decisions Siyuan Yin, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA Nicolette J Sullivan, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Scott A Huettel Many real-world decisions are difficult because they require tradeoffs between moral principles and utilitarian factors. For example, some hospitals have courted controversy for denying an otherwise eligible patient’s claim of an organ transplant if they refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Others may require six months of abstinence before a liver transplant. Here, in a laboratory study, we investigate participants’ organ transplant decisions based on utilitarian (post-transplant life expectancy) and moral (past lifestyle decisions) attributes. We vary the utilitarian benefit as well as the moral valence (the patient is either praiseworthy or blameworthy) to estimate tradeoffs between these two  attributes. Further, in some cases-as in real life-a patient who had already been designated to receive an organ is reassessed in light of a new, perhaps more worthy, candidate. We implemented a series of Bayesian computational models to assess specifically how three variables influenced decisions: (1) the weight on expected post-transplant life expectancy, (2) blameworthiness or praiseworthiness, and (3) the bias toward a previously selected patient. The best model suggests that our participants make decisions based on post-transplant life expectancy, and more importantly, the moral valence of each patient’s lifestyle (e.g., prior alcohol use). We further illustrate how eye gaze (assessed using eye-tracking) and decision process parameters (assessed using drift diffusion modeling) influence the decision-making process to result in trade-offs between moral and utilitarian attributes. These also allow us to understand when and how previously-selected patients gain an advantage in choice, independent of these attributes.
