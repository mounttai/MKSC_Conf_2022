14- Understanding Impact of Ad Length on Campaign Performance with Amazon Audio Ads Alyson Sprague, Amazon, San Francisco, CA Luba Smolensky We seek to understand the impact of ad length on Amazon audio ad campaign performance, and provide ad length recommendations based on a brand’s campaign goals. We measured four KPIs to achieve this objective using both 1P Amazon retail metrics and 3P brand lift metrics. For instance, we reviewed ad length impact on ad recall, reported brand favorability, and reported consideration using third-party brand lift insights. Furthermore, we analyzed Amazon detail page view rate to evaluate brand consideration for brands that sell products on Amazon. We also controlled for campaign length and frequency to ensure performance was influenced mostly by ad length and not other campaign factors. This research identified three data-backed recommendations to help determine the right ad length for advertiser’s Amazon Ads audio campaigns. First, we’ve found in our study that ad length did impact performance. We recommend brands use these insights to plan their Amazon Ads audio campaign, selecting the ad length most appropriate for their campaign goal. Second, we recommend brands aiming to improve upper-funnel metrics use shorter ad lengths (:10-:20seconds), as these ad lengths tended to work better in these metrics. Lastly, we recommend brands  aiming to improve mid-funnel metrics use longer audio ads (:21-:30seconds), as these ad lengths tended to work better in driving DPVR and reported consideration.
