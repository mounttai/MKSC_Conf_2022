3 - Platform Design and Supplier Response Malika Korganbekova, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL On two-sided platforms, there are information frictions between suppliers and the platform itself: suppliers, while setting their wholesale costs and on-platform sponsored  advertising budgets, are uncertain as to how these strategies will translate to the ranking of their products on the platform. That is, suppliers do not have full knowledge over the Artificial Intelligence algorithm employed by the platform to rank products. In this paper, we investigate how sophisticated and fast suppliers are in terms of reacting to the changes in the ranking system. More specifically, North American durable goods platform we collaborate with, ran a ranking experiment where a product was assigned a score and we use discontinuities in the product scores to estimate quasi-experimental effects of the ranking changes on subsequent changes in supplier wholesale costs and sponsored advertising budgets. We find that there’s significant heterogeneity in how different suppliers respond to the changes in the ranking system depending on suppliers’ experience with the platform and number of products carried. Next, using pricing and sponsored ad experiments ran by the platform, we estimate causal benchmarks of the effectiveness of modifying wholesale costs and sponsored ad bids. We develop a Bayesian learning model to recover suppliers’ beliefs about the effectiveness of the above- mentioned wholesale cost and sponsored bid changes to estimate the information gap between supplier beliefs and causal estimates of these strategies. Using counterfactual simulations, we show that in the full information setting when suppliers know causal effects of price and sponsored bid changes, both platform and suppliers can benefit, and consumers will face lower prices.
