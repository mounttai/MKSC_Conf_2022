2 - Categorization Meets Prospect Theory: Distorted Perceptions of Probabilities and Outcomes Crossing Categorical Boundaries Alina Ferecatu, RSM Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands Dan Schley  We investigate the impact of numerical categorisation on Prospect Theory. Prospect Theory models how people distort objective probabilities and outcomes, and documents behavioral regularities such as diminishing sensitivity to increasing outcomes (the value function), a tendency to overweight low probability events, and a tendency to underweight high probability events (the probability weighting function). When describing a prospect, which is a combination of an outcome and its probability of occurrence, objective values and probabilities are often represented numerically, therefore additional distortion may arise due to how people encode and categorize these numbers. One example of such categorization is the well-documented left- digit effect, which is a tendency to focus on the leftmost digit of a number and not pay sufficient attention to the remaining digits. For instance, an objective value of 435 tends to be underestimated, and seen as 400 and something. The left- digit bias is present in various context, including pricing (e.g.,
