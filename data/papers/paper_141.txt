4 - Role of Identity Based Motivation in Replication of Non-traditional Women-run Financial Entity Rachel Ramey, University of Georgia, Athens, GA Sundar G Bharadwaj, Ellen McCullough The nonprofit organization CARE International (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere) has spent decades investing in developing Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) groups around the world to alleviate global poverty. These savings groups are comprised of 15-30 low income  members, mostly women, who are trained to collectively save money. It requires extensive monetary and human resources to form all the savings groups, and a desire to reach as many communities as possible while responsibly spending donor funds has encouraged CARE International to seek economical ways to increase the rate of new VSLA group formation, such as replication. Replication is when members of an existing savings group form a new savings group in their community without reliance on CARE resources. By applying the marketing concepts of intrinsic motivation and identity-based motivation, this research seeks to increase the replication rate of savings groups thus increasing their reach and global impact. This study reports the results of a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted with a sample of 1120 VSLA savings groups in Malawi using a replication training intervention. This research contributes to the marketing literature by examining identity-based motivation as a non-monetary incentive in a field setting over a long time period.
