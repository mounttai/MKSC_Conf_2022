4 - Love Despite Flaws-impact of Algorithmic Decision Systems on Inventory Ordering Decisions Yingda Lu, University of Illinois-Chicago, Chicago, IL Xueming Luo, Liqiang Huang Companies are increasingly adopting Algorithmic Decision Systems (ADS) to improve their business decision makings in recent years. In this paper, we examine the impact of ADS on inventory ordering decisions using field experiment. Given that managers often have private information that facilitates their decision making, we focus on the human- algorithm interactions in the use of ADS. We find that ADS generally increases the performance of inventory ordering decisions, and this effect is more salient for products with lower sales and higher uncertainties. We further hypothesize that providing ADS performance feedback information can improve the transparency of ADS, and consequently improve the inventory ordering decisions. Interestingly, while both providing positive and negative ADS performance feedback information can further improve inventory ordering decisions, providing negative ADS performance feedback information is more effective compared with providing positive information. This result also sheds light on the managerial implications of using ADS within corporations.
