1 - Rating Service Professionals First Reduces Tip Amount in Sequential Decisions Jinjie Chen, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Alison Jing Xu, Maria A. Rodas, Xuefeng Liu Tips play an important role in the economy. In U.S. restaurants, $47 billion is tipped annually (Azar, 2011), and tips often represent over half the income of people working in the food-service business (PayScale, 2015). As the COVID-19 Pandemic led to an exponential increase in the popularity and importance of app-based services, such as food and grocery deliveries (Huet & Chapman, 2020), tipping is an important income source for service professionals in more industries. New technological advances pose new questions to be answered. For example, as rating service professionals become more prevalent (e.g., Uber, Instacart), how would the order of rating and tipping affect each other? We propose that rating a service professional first decreases tip amount, based on two theory-driven assumptions. First, tipping (i.e., parting with money) is economically costly and psychologically painful, and, hence, aversive (Prelec & Loewenstein, 1998). Second, people can flexibly categorize things based on their needs and goals (Poynor & Haws, 2009).  Therefore, when consumers have the opportunity to rate the service professional first, they can categorize both ratings and tips into one category of rewards to the service professional. As the result, they feel justified to tip less. However, since rating is costless, tipping first would not influence how people rate. We demonstrated this effect in seven studies, including two field studies, one secondary-data analysis, and four lab experiments. Indeed, rating first led to smaller tip amounts, and tipping first did not influence ratings. The findings contribute to the literature of tipping, categorization, and sequential decision making. Our results can also help firms design better consumer decision architecture for their platforms.
