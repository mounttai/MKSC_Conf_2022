2 - Luxury Content Becomes Viral on Social Media: The Positive Role of Disfluency Zitian Qiu, PhD Student, HEC Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland Felicitas Morhart Luxury brands nowadays create social media content that they hope their audiences will share to increase brand awareness. Existing studies suggest that firms should create fluent content (e.g., using shorter sentences and simpler vocabularies) to ensure content virality, but we propose this strategy does not fit luxury brands. By analyzing 3,695 Facebook posts published by luxury and mainstream brands from different product sectors during 2017-2019, we find that disfluent content using longer sentences and more infrequently used vocabularies, if published by luxury (mainstream) brands, receives more (less) shares. We believe the psychological mechanism behind this effect is that  disfluent (vs. fluent) content is perceived more psychologically distant, and hence better satisfies luxury audiencesâ€™ status desires for differentiating themselves from the masses.
