2 - Does Behavioral Targeting Hurt Brands? The Effect of Third-party Data Sharing on Brand Attitudes Ngan Vo, PhD Candidate, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada Rajesh V. Manchanda Behavioral targeting has become a dominant approach to target consumers in the digital economy. This marketing practice has accelerated thanks to technological advances that constantly monitor consumer behavior (e.g., through search data, browsing history, voice recognition) and via unauthorized data sharing practices among firms. Although some work has suggested that behavioral targeting benefits firms (e.g., improving consumers’ response to advertisements, improving performance of communication), this stream of research has largely assumed that consumers were unaware of such practices. Today such naivety is, however, rare. In fact, consumers feel strongly about their information privacy: 55.8 % of consumers feel the loss of their privacy and favor the enactment of strong information privacy laws, up from 26% in Westin’s 2000 study. In this research, we provide more evidence for the downside of behavioral targeting practices. Through two studies, we find that behavioral targeting in which third-party data sharing practice were made more salient was detrimental to both focal and affiliated brands. Specifically, controlling for pre-brand attitudes, consumers in the behavioral targeting condition (vs. control condition) reported less favorable brand attitudes towards both focal and affiliated brands. This effect was mediated by an increase in consumers’ perception of creepiness following a behavioral targeting practice. We also found evidence for the moderating role of individuals’ level of privacy knowledge, which has been understudied in privacy research. Specifically, the indirect effect was significant among those who have moderate and high level of privacy knowledge, but insignificant among those who have low level of privacy knowledge.
