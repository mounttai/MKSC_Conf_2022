1 - Principal, Agent, and Information in Healthcare Product Choice: The Case of U.S. Renal Disease Patients’ Choice of Dialysis Center TI Tongil Kim, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX Reza Roshangarzadeh, Shervin Tehrani Dialysis is a critical means to extend the lifespan of more than 400,000 End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients in the U.S., whose treatment accounts for approximately 20% of the U.S. Medicare program. As a result, quality-of-care improvement in this domain implies not only saving more lives, but also reducing substantial healthcare costs. For first-time dialysis patients, their choice of dialysis center is of utmost importance as it can significantly affect their overall well- being during treatment for ESRD. This decision process, as is  often the case for uncommon, complex healthcare products, is usually an outcome of shared-decision making between the patient and physician. This study analyzes such decision making under uncertainty in the principal-agent problem, where the agent (i.e., physician) makes recommendations about treatment options for the principal (i.e., patient). Using 2013-2015 data on U.S. ESRD patients and their referring physicians who recommend a set of dialysis centers for new patients, we aim to structurally model patients’ dialysis center selection process. Our model accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty in the environment, such as physicians’ uncertainty about the characteristics of dialysis centers and the match values of specific centers to their heterogeneous patients, as well as the patients’ uncertainty about the value of each recommended center to their needs. Given our structural framework, we can empirically recover the agents’ recommendation to principals, which allows us to explore ways to improve quality-of-care through counterfactual analyses.
