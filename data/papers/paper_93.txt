4 - Does TV Advertising Drive Mortgage Refinance Decisions? Zhenling Jiang, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA Donggwan Kim This paper studies how TV advertising affects consumersâ€™ loan decisions in the mortgage market. It is well documented that many consumers fail to refinance when interest rates decline. This can be problematic because consumers lose out on substantial savings, resulting in frictions in the transmission of monetary policy to consumption. Can TV advertising increase refinance activities? We combine 4 years of individual level mortgage origination data and TV advertising volume as well as video content to answer this question. We find that refinance advertising significantly increases refinancing volume (i.e., market expansive effect) as well as the choice of lenders (i.e., business stealing effect). In contrast, advertising targeted at new mortgages shows little effect in increasing volume, but it influences lender choice. Our results suggest that advertising can be an effective tool to encourage refinancing activities when interest rates are low. Finally, we extract the topics from TV advertising videos to study the effectiveness of different messaging content among heterogeneous consumers. Results shed light on what advertising topics work better for what types of borrowers. Our results have important implications for the government to increase monetary policy pass through from refinancing as well as mortgage lenders to design their advertising strategy.
