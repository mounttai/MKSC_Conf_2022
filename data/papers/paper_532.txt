1 - Measuring Preferences for Hedonic Consumption Hannah H. Chang, Singapore Management University, Singapore Anirban Mukherjee  Many products are chosen, purchased, and used for hedonic consumption. Examples include watching a movie, listening to music, and getting a massage. We develop a novel consumer preference measurement method for hedonic experiences. In our method, participants are presented with, and choose between, verbally described experiences. To analyze participants’ choices, we develop a novel model that fuses state-of-the-art neural language processing with hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Our method and model facilitate (1) the measurement of consumer preferences for hedonic experiences, (2) the computation of the contribution of product attributes to consumers’ utility, and (3) the development of counterfactuals that are crucial to the management of hedonic experiences. We apply our method to study preferences for wines made in 427 wine-growing regions, in 44 wine-growing countries, from 708 wine-grape varietals. We show that our model provides superior in-sample description and generates better out-of-sample predictions of participant choices than benchmark models. We use the components of the model for marketing decisions such as choosing between products (wines) that provide distinct hedonic experiences but are observationally equivalent in product attributes and therefore indistinguishable in attribute-based models, and fine-tuning the experience provided by a product (wine) to improve its appeal to consumers.
