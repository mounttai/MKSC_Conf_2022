4 - Free Riding the Return Stock: How to Turn Returns into a Profit Driver Scott Andrew Neslin, Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH Elisa Montaguti, Sara Valentini Returning products has become standard practice among consumers, and the habit of returning merchandising does not diminish over customers’ lifetime. Returns have become a significant pain point for online retailers. However, it is exacerbated by retailers’ marketing activities, which can encourage customers to make riskier purchases, thus producing more returns (Shehu et al., 2020). Paradoxically, we contend that returns in fact can enable retailers to allocate marketing moreefficiently and hence maximize profits. Specifically, firms can maximize profits by optimally allocating marketing resources to feed the stock of ‘goodwill’ generated by product returns. This stock translates into increased profits in the long term. To test this hypothesis, we estimate a four- equation model that traces the impact of different marketing activities on purchase behavior, order size, decision to return, and the amount returned. The model includes a return stock variable capturing the dynamic effect of returns on purchase behavior. We then dynamically optimize the marketing resource budget allocation taking into account returns. Our results show that the return stock dynamics can be leveraged to increase customer profitability. As a result, companies can free ride on product returns and increase profits by better shaping their marketing activities. We also show that ignoring the product return dynamics will lead managers to incorrect marketing decisions.
