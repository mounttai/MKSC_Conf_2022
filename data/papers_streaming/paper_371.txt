1 - Impact of Market Structure on Regulatory Compliance: Evidence from Online Censorship in China Z. Jessie Liu, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD This paper studies the role of market structure in regulatory compliance through a unique empirical example: censorship via content removal by three major live-streaming platforms in China. Based on 30 unexpected sensitive events, I first present reduced-form evidence that the largest platform censored a higher number of keywords and complied faster  on average than the smaller platforms. I then develop and estimate a structural model where platforms compete for users by choosing whether to comply with the government’s censorship requests. By complying immediately, platforms may lose users who prefer to evade censorship by switching out. By delaying compliance, platforms incur a political cost but it also allows them to attract new users from their competitors who quickly comply with the government’s censorship requests. My counterfactual analysis predicts that centralizing market power via merging or shutting down small platforms could backfire and lead to a lower scope of censorship.
