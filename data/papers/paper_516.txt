9 - Product-line Design with Consumer Habit Formation Dawei Jian, University of California-Riverside, Riverside, CA Consumers’ repeated purchasing behavior prompts them to form a habit. How should the firm design the product line? We study a new product line design problem, where the consumer’s private valuation fluctuates endogenously over time as driven by consumer habit formation. By leaving the consumer a stake in the future, the optimal prices resemble the advance selling and price discount structure to prevent the well-known cannibalization problem. The firm should design the product line quality to internalize both contemporaneous externalities caused by cannibalization and intertemporal externalities due to habit formation. The optimal quality characterizes two effects of consumer habit. Despite the direct welfare effect that increases future surplus, habit formation exhibits indirect strategic effect: by changing future consumer heterogeneity, habit formation can either exacerbate or alleviate the cannibalization problem, depending on whether the formation process is strong or weak. We also provide practical implications to guide the practice. First, we identify reasons why firms should consider valuation endogeneity when selling the goods: it can leverage consumer uncertainty, exploit consumer habits, and homogenize consumer preferences. Understanding these economic forces can help avoid the pitfalls in product-line design. Second, we discuss when promotions fail to benefit the firm, and provide the firm to carefully promote: either low-end consumers have sufficient mass, or habit formation is sufficiently weak, excessive promotions can hurt the firm.
