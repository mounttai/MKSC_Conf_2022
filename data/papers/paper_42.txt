3 - An Empirical Investigation of Whether Algorithmic Pricing induces Disparate Impact in Online Retailing Rafael Becerril Arreola, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC This work investigates the presence and nature of disparate impact in online retailing. A custom-built auditing platform collected price data from a major online retailer, including 20,000 different grocery products at more than 7,000 randomly-selected zip codes in the continental . Prices were then matched to consumer demographic data from the U.S. census and IRS. The data collected indicates that prices are higher for zip codes with higher average income, larger proportions of low-income consumers, and larger proportions of minority consumers. Most results hold even without automated recommendations, but price steering induces somewhat different correlations between prices and demographics. The results do not seem to be explained by consumer demand, supply-side costs, nor price elasticities.
