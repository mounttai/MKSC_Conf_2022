2 - Relaxing Functional Form in Choice Models through Gaussian Processes Samuel I. Levy, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA Richard Mirman, Alan Montgomery Consumers change their choice as expenditures within a category increase. Traditional choice models usually make restrictive structural assumptions to specify the expenditure elasticity. This imposed functional form of utility strongly influences the range of estimable substitution patterns across goods. Consumers with highly nonlinear preferences may have consumption thresholds in which buying patterns dramatically change when price or budget changes. Understanding these thresholds with a flexible utility-based model could lead to improved pricing and promotion decisions. Using Gaussian process priors on utility functions, we relax the functional form of both inside goods and outside good, within the context of constrained utility maximization. We estimate a general direct utility choice  model for simultaneous purchases within a product category. We build a hierarchical model by borrowing information from a parametric functional form that constitutes an informative prior at the individual level. Our model captures non- linear rates of satiation and precise baseline preferences that traditional non-homothetic parametric models fail to capture by assuming a given functional form of utility. The proposed model automatically detects non-linear patterns of consumption from the data and provide a more precise statistical inference.
