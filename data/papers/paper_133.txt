1 - The Tucker Carlson Effect: Economic Consequences of Socio-political Activism Rahul Suhag, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC Rajdeep Grewal, Frank Germann Tucker Carlson, TV host on Fox News, is popular for his right- leaning ideology and for making ‘controversial’ statements. Such statements have led to various activist groups calling upon brands to stop advertising during his show. We study the economic consequences of statements in which Carlson took a public stance on two prominent socio-political issues: Immigration (in 2018) and Black Lives Matter (in 2020). Using multisource data from Kantar Media and Nielsen TV, and employing a novel Bayesian synthetic difference in differences (BSDID) method, we estimate the impact of Carlson’s controversial statements on not only his show’s advertising revenue but also the supply-side (i.e., advertisers) drivers of that revenue. We find that Carlson’s show lost advertising revenue following the first event in 2018. In contrast, advertising revenue did not decline following the second event in 2020. Mechanism analyses indicate that, following the 2018 event, the number of advertised brands on Tucker Carlson’s show declined along with the cost of advertising, and even though each of the remaining advertisers was given a longer advertising window, it couldn’t mitigate the effect. Supplementary analysis suggests that advertising brands became more homogenous and politically aligned (i.e., conservative) with Carlson’s ideology, likely buffering the show from advertising losses following the 2020 event. Therefore, even though we see a decline in the cost of advertising following the 2020 event, the revenue does not decrease this  time around, as advertisers do not depart. These findings highlight the need for both the advertising channels and the brands to be even more diligent in their selection of strategic partners.
