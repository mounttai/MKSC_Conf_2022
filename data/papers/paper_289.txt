4 - Brand Share and Long-lasting Effect of Capital Relationship: The Case of Japanese Supermarket and Convenience-store Chains Mitsukuni Nishida, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, Baltimore, MD Although there is a large body of literature on the market share dominance of first-mover firms, less is known about the effect of their shareholder companies’ entry behavior on the entry and performance of their subsidiaries. This paper documents how shareholder companies affect entry behavior and firm performance of subsidiaries in related but different industries. I leverage a panel of store counts and entry order by the geographic market for Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores from 1945 to 2013. I document two empirical patterns. First, in geographic markets where their parent companies (mainly supermarket chains) have developed in the past, convenience-store chains tend to enter earlier than their competitors. Second, controlling for  the entry order of convenience-store chains, a convenience- store chain’s market share tends to be higher when its parent company enters the market earlier than its competitors.
