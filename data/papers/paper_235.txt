2 - The Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic on Consumer Sustainable Consumption Steve Zhang, PhD student, New York University Stern School of Business, New York, NY Bryan K Bollinger, Randi Kronthal-Sacco, Levin Zhu The coronavirus pandemic has significantly altered many aspects of our life. Although recent literature has studied how consumers change their behaviors in the new norm of social distancing (Chetty et al., 2020; Tucker and Yu, 2020), how the pandemic impacts consumers’ sustainable consumption has not been studied. This question is of great importance to both brands and researchers for several reasons. First, Bollinger et al. (2020) show that sustainable products are more likely to have price premiums over their non-sustainable counterparts. Whether sustainable products can maintain this premium in the economic downturn due to the pandemic, especially when the first wave of coronavirus hit the US, remains unclear, and we explore its relative impact on sustainable versus non-sustainable consumption. Second, small and large-scale experiments have confirmed that outdoor exposure can shift consumers’ sustainable behaviors (Nisbet and Zelenski, 2011; Alcock et al., 2020). The record number of outdoor visitations, due to the social distancing guidelines during the pandemic, has propelled us to hypothesize that outdoor visitations are among the mechanisms driving the coronavirus pandemic impact on sustainable consumption. Through the lens of social distancing, we combine public COVID case data and proprietary geo-location data with store-level retail scanner data to study how the coronavirus pandemic has changed consumers’ consumption of sustainable products. Our preliminary findings suggest that social distancing impacts consumers’ propensity to purchase products with labels promoting their sustainability.
