1 - How to Mitigate the Negative Effects of Competitors’ Black Lives Matter Activism on Social Media: Coupling Natural Experiments and Machine Learning Marco Qin, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA Yang Wang, Xueming Luo The recent Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement shocked our society and reached a dramatic climax with over 450 major protests spanning across the globe. Our research quantifies the causal impact of competitors’ BLM activism on a focal brand and examines how to mitigate the possible negative impact for the focal brand. We use a difference- in-differences modeling approach and advanced machine learning algorithms (GAN-BERT) to analyze unstructured social media textual data by taking advantage of the Blackout Tuesday, an event during which numerous brands expressed BLM solidarity by posting black squares on Instagram, but not Twitter, as a natural experiment. Based on a unique dataset involving 312 brands from the competitive and concentrated fashion industry and 225,918 social media posts, we find a significantly negative impact of competitors’ BLM postings on focal brands’ social media engagement. Relative to their Twitter accounts without Blackout Tuesday posts, focal brands whose competitors supported the Blackout Tuesday BLM event on Instagram gained 36% fewer followers and experienced an additional 15% decrease in consumer liking. Fortunately, focal brands can assuage such a negative impact of competitors’ BLM activism through a battery of mitigation approaches. From a top-down approach, brands that build a large number of social media followers and whose close rivals are not intensely engaged in BLM activism are less prone to this negative impact. Furthermore, from a bottom- up approach, focal brands can leverage pre-emptive BLM postings prior to the event to mitigate the negative impact. Interestingly, another bottom-up approach of using follow-up copycat BLM posts by the focal brand immediately after its rival brands’ activism backfires even more when the top-down  factor of rival BLM activism intensity is high; however, if the focal brand is late to the BLM movement but still wants to support social justice causes, it can do so to show its moral obligations and not suffer from the negative impact when competitors’ activism intensity is low.
