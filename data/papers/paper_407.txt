1 - Understanding the Role of Advertising in Driving Store Traffic: The Case of Home Improvement Stores Bowen Luo, Northeastern University, Boston, MA Bhoomija Ranjan We investigate the role of advertising in driving store traffic using a mobile location panel with store visits of six million individuals. We explore how own and rival advertising effects vary with customer-to-store distances, ad content, and customer expertise. Customers make significantly more visits to stores that are closer than competitor stores. We find a positive own advertising effect that is diminishing in the customer-to-store distance, suggesting travel costs attenuate ad effect. Rival ads, on the other hand, might steal traffic or generate a positive spillover, depending on the customer distance to the own store and the rival store. We also find promotional ads more effective in driving own store traffic than non-promotional ads, but rival promotional ads are more harmful than rival non-promotional ads. While the absolute advertising effects vary with customer expertise, the percentage effects do not, suggesting retailer advertising is not working by conveying information about product quality. Our findings imply retailer advertising works through communicating promotions and reminding consumers and raising their attention to the retail brand and the category.
