1 - Does Machine Learning Amplify Pricing Errors in Housing Market?: Economics of ML Feedback Loops Nikhil Malik, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA Platforms like Zillow offer Machine Learning algorithm (ML pricing) that predict sale prices for residential homes. These ML price models learn from observed sale prices, and simultaneously also influence those same sales. We analytically model this cyclical relationship between ML price and sale price (machine - human) called the ML feedback loop. We show that the ML price has a self-fulfilling nature which results in the ML model underestimating its own pricing error and market participants over-relying on the ML price. We show that these outcomes are more adverse when adoption of ML prices among market participants is higher. We identify market conditions in which introduction of ML pricing amplifies, instead of alleviating, erratic sale prices and makes seller payoffs worse off. We also find that sellers who are impatient, risk-neutral and have high ability to price privately - have most to gain from introduction of ML pricing. Using data from Zillow we empirically validate primitive building block of our analytical model. We find that home sale prices in 2019 had a significant 15% sensitivity to Zillowâ€™s ML price (e.g., a $10,000 perturbation in the ML price shifts the sale price by $1,500). Finally, we suggest ML design choices that could correct the feedback loop. We discuss whether platforms are incentivized to follow these corrective strategies and the role of policymakers in regulating the same.
