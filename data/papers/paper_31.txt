3 - Impact of Brand Activism on Polarization of Consumer Purchase Behavior and Consumer Portfolio Riskiness Sayan Gupta, PhD student, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA  Vanitha Swaminathan Brands’ participation in socio-political activism (Bhagwat et al. 2020) could be double-edged interventions - garnering whole-hearted support from one end of the spectrum of consumers, while alienating customers from across the aisle. This study aims to demonstrate real-world implications of such brand actions using actual county-level purchase data of consumer brands aggregated from Nielsen Retail Scanner and Consumer Panel records, and then subjecting them to an event study analysis - i.e., by using a repository of brand activism announcements on traditional media as exogenous shocks to consumer markets (Bhagwat et al. 2020). Employing an analysis of market shares and their Recency-Frequency- Magnitude drivers in addition to consumer acquisition and attrition, the study quantifies the level of polarization infused within activist brands’ consumer portfolios. To do so, we track these metrics at the county-level across a 15-year panel data and perform a generalized triple Diff-in-Diff event study analysis (Autor 2003; Currie et al. 2015) to estimate how these are impacted vis-a-vis a matched control group of brands, and across counties with varying ideological and religious compositions (based on their voting patterns and Census data, as per Khan et al. 2013). Finally, the study quantifies the riskiness embedded in these divisive brand actions by analyzing their impact on overall consumer portfolio risk - by first classifying counties into deciles of varying levels of political alignment, then treating them as large contractual customers, and using their profitability means and coefficients of variation to compute customer beta and deviations from an efficient consumer asset portfolio (Tarasi et al. 2011).
