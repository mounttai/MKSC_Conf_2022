3 - Voice Analytics of Online Influencers — Soft Selling in Branded Videos Serim Hwang, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA Xiao Liu, Kannan Srinivasan Influencers have been growing rapidly on social media and the influencer marketing industry is now worth $15 billion. As more consumers rely on influencers’ recommendations for shopping, the trustworthiness of influencers becomes a key question. Specifically, consumers increasingly question the credibility of influencers while watching sponsored videos. To help consumers make informed shopping decisions, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s endorsement guidelines require influencers to disclose sponsorship. However, little is known about how influencers react to the FTC’s endorsement guidelines. This paper studies how influencers change their vocal delivery upon sponsorship and how their vocal changes affect consumer sentiment. For identification, we employ three causal identification strategies (IV, FRD, and TWFE). For feature representation, we leverage computer vision deep learning methods such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a leading object detection model (Mask R-CNN). As a result, we find that influencers choose a soft selling strategy and significantly tone down their voice loudness in sponsored videos. This voice modulation strategy can help influencers win back favorable consumer sentiment. Influencers who are not-yet-famous but rapidly accumulating their Instagram followers are likely to use the voice loudness modulation strategy. Our research provides implications for the government (FTC), firms, influencers, and consumers.
