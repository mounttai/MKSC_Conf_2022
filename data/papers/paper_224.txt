3 - Hitting the Right Target? Pricing and Advertising Strategies in Digital Markets Grazia Cecere, Institut Mines-Telecom Business School, Evry, France Wilfried Sand-Zantman, Sarah Lemaire Display advertising markets rely on information provided by firms and consumers to provide ads to the right target. We investigate how a monopoly ad network should extract this information to price its advertising campaigns for commercial firms. We assume that the network is better able to identify the right target audiences but this requires it to know the firmâ€™s heterogeneous characteristics, both  in audience and value. We show how the network copes with this heterogeneity by altering the efficency of the targeting process and the prices charged to different types of firms. In particular, we show that narrower audience may be associated to lower prices to induce truthful information disclosure by firms.
