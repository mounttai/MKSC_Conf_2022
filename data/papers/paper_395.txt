4 - Modeling the Composition of Online Assortments and its Impact on the Consumer Decision Journey: An Empirical Study of an OTA Website R Venkatesh, Professor of Business Administration, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA K Pallavi Jha, Rabikar Chatterjee Online retailers, or e-tailers, have the ability to present distinct online assortments in response to consumers’ specific search queries. In this study, we empirically examine the influence of two types of assortments—an available set provided by the e-tailer and a subsequent consideration set formed by the consumer— on consideration set formation and choice. We conceptualize two assortment characteristics: (a) Assortment heterogeneity or the diversity of the e-tailer’s presented offerings on vertical attributes, such as ratings that connote a quality differential among alternatives, and horizontal attributes, such as the appearance of offerings that appeal to differences in consumer tastes; and (b) Assortment organization or the nature of ordering or sequencing of offerings within an assortment. Drawing on economic and behavioral theories of differentiation, variety, and consideration, we propose and empirically test a set of propositions linking the above-noted independent and dependent variables. Our two-stage econometric model is estimated on a large secondary dataset from a leading online travel agency (OTA) for hotel search and choice in a popular European capital. While the initial consideration stage relies on a multinomial logit model, the later purchase stage draws on rare events modeling methods to account for the low  conversion rate from consideration to purchase. The empirical results of the study as well as their theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.
