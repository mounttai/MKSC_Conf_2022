1 - Reducing Ad Waste: Optimal Targeting with Point Processes Henrique Laurino dos Santos, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA Digital platforms offer marketers uniquely individualized channels to monitor and directly interact with consumers, and while those enable the design of more granular advertising policies, the complexity of optimizing those policies is also greatly increased. To maximize the effectiveness of advertising, marketers must choose who and when to advertise to under the consideration that users may be reachable in near-continuous time. Extant optimization models in advertising and direct marketing are broadly built to either be granular at the consumer or time level, but rarely both. This study presents a model for individual- level, continuous-time, purchase timing in the presence of consumer burnout. The model can flexibly accommodate a variety of advertising impulse-response equations and provides simple regularity conditions for the inclusion of endogenous usage-feedback loops as well as burnout mechanisms. I also introduce two stylized optimization tasks that represent the decision problems of a service provider  designing an advertising policy directly and of a digital platform hired to design short-term policies for the primary service provider. Under limited regularity conditions the model can be used to quickly estimate optimal advertising scheduling policies for both tasks, either through closed- form analytical solutions or simple numerical approximations. The model prescribes a long-term optimal minimal burnout level, with advertising frequency (and consumer burnout) decreasing as costs increase and increasing as the myopic agentâ€™s planning period decreases.
