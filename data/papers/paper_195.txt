3 - The Impact of Uncertainty on Customer Satisfaction: Evidence from Amazon Reviews Camila Back, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany Martin Spann Customer satisfaction is an important metric to predict customer behavior and as a result firms’ profitability. Expectations of a product’s performance serve as a reference point against which customers evaluate their satisfaction with the products’ actual performance. But reference points are usually conceptualized as single point estimates. So what effect does uncertainty in expectations have? The current paper offers a theoretical model of satisfaction, in which expectations reflect distributions of individual beliefs about performance outcomes. This approach allows us to capture potential effects from comparing actual performance levels to (multiple) levels that could have been. Based on this model, uncertainty shifts subjective reference points upward. That is, uncertainty increases the performance level at which customers shift from being dissatisfied to being satisfied. Furthermore, uncertainty has an attenuating effect on both positive and negative deviations of actual performance from subjective reference points. Put differently, a bad performance feels less bad and a good performance feels less good when it is expected, compared with unexpected. We find support for our model’s predictions by analyzing product review data from Amazon, where we operationalize satisfaction based on individual customers’ ratings and infer actual product performance from objective quality ratings. An experiment under controlled conditions further corroborates our findings. These results have implications for the communication of uncertainty (e.g., when to communicate broad or wide ranges of expected performance) and shed light on firms’ abilities to extract value from inferred uncertainty levels by customizing customer valuation and recovery strategies.
