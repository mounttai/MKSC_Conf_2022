1 - The Effect of Recommender Systems on Online Investor Behaviors Ruiqi Zhu, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA Recommender systems have been widely applied in online retailing, which have been shown to have an impact on consumers’ purchase behavior. The growing online E-commerce platforms where people can invest in mutual fund and financial products also see the prevailing existence of recommender systems. However, their impact on online investors’ behavior is rarely documented. The distinction between investment and purchase behaviors as well as the attributional difference between financial and consumer products make the conclusions in previous literature doubtful to apply. In this paper, we employ regression discontinuity approach to causally examine the effect of recommender systems on online investor behaviors in mutual fund investment. The results show that (1) recommender systems have a significantly positive effect on purchase; (2) the recommendation effect is heterogeneous across different types of mutual fund and investors with different characteristics; and (3) the effect on holding period of recommended funds is heterogeneous across different investors. In addition, we examine the mechanisms and implications.
