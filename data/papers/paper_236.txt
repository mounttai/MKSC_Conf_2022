3 - CSR Vs. ESG: Choice of Name Reflects Underlying Approach to Corporate Sustainability Tushmit M. Hasan, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX Verdiana Giannetti, Raji Srinivasan There has been a growing pressure on firms to be cognizant of their impact on society and the environment, but there has been much debate regarding whether firms’ engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) comes at the expense of shareholders. However, recently, there has been a renewed pressure on firms to improve their performance on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues,  driven primarily by investors who are increasingly becoming interested in socially responsible investing (SRI). We believe that ESG is a re-emergence of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) but with a key difference - we believe a firms’ choice in using CSR vs. ESG in their communication reflects their approach towards corporate sustainability. Using a panel dataset of tweets from S&P500 firms between 2015- 2020, we present empirical evidence of firms’ difference in focus via topic modeling. We investigate the drivers of firms’ choice to use CSR vs. ESG in their tweets. We also compare the stock market reactions to firms’ CSR vs. ESG tweets. Our results indicate that by moving away from the narrative- based efforts of CSR towards goal-driven and metrics- driven ESG efforts, certain types of firms may be generating better returns by approaching corporate sustainability as ESG rather than as CSR.
