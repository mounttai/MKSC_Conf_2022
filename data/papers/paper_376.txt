2 - Retailer-direct Financing and Channel Structures Yuyang Zhao, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China Luying Wang, Yunchuan Liu, Hui Yang We study the effect of retailer-direct financing on channel structure choice when a retailer can provide sales promotion service. A capital-constrained supplier can receive financial support from a capital-abundant retailer for production and sell products through the retailer’s agency channel, reselling channel, or both channels. The retailer can decide the channel structures and provide corresponding sales promotion services to increase the demand with an effort. We design a game-theoretic model to explore the impact of the strategic interaction between retailer and supplier on channel structure choice by considering the retailer’s financial service and sales promotion service. Counter-intuitively, we find a reselling channel could be more efficient than a reselling- agency dual-channel even the commission rate in the agency selling or the cost of the sales effort on providing promotion service is high. The retailer could prevent the supplier from free-riding the retailer’s effort by designing a contract with financial support, and therefore double-marginalization effect could be mitigated as well. Our study provides new insights into the channel structure choice with the interface between supply chain finance and marketing promotion.
