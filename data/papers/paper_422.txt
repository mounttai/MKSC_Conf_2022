2 - Nature Leads Social Media and Beer Sales: Weather vs. Price in a Dark Market Işıl Büdeyri Turan, PhD Fellow, Özyeğin University, Istanbul, Turkey M. Tolga Akçura, Koen Pauwels Changes in weather have significant impact on consumption patterns. This impact extends to social media behavior. This paper studies the impact of year-on-year weather changes and extreme temperature variations on beer consumption as well as the corresponding user-generated content on social media. The authors build a vector autoregressive model to investigate the dynamic interactions among sales, social media volume, valence and price, using temperature in the model specification. The findings help assess how the effectiveness of a social media volume generating campaign can be optimized based on price, positive valence and weather analytics. The results suggest that the direct impact of temperature on sales is much stronger than that of price, and price promotions may not always work in increasing the effectiveness of a social media campaign, and thus sales. The paper discusses strategies that managers can follow to increase social media campaign effectiveness when temperature impact is stronger vs. weaker. Moreover, the paper emphasizes the necessity of incorporating effective weather parameters into social media and sales analytics, for getting unbiased estimations and generating optimal social media campaign strategies.
