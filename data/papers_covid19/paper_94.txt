1 - Untouchable: An Exploration of Consumers’ Haptic Behavior in Shopping During the COVID Era Joy L. Shields, Pepperdine University, Malibu, CA Cristel A. Russell, Clark Johnson, Joann Peck Touch is an important component in the consumer in-store shopping experience. This project highlights the coping mechanisms that consumers implemented when haptic interactions with products were limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To shed light on this phenomenon, a longitudinal qualitative design, focusing on a panel of 31 consumers who were the primary shoppers in their homes prior to, after, and during the height of the pandemic was conducted. Initial findings signal that the process through which consumers adjusted to the inability to touch resembles the stages of grief. Indeed, participants report many of the facets and experiences previously outlined in models of the grief process, for instance, Bowlby and Parkes’ (1970) four stages of grief. In the first stage, Shock & Numbness, some consumers felt a sense of loss due to their inability to freely engage haptically with products as they once did. In the second stage, Yearning & Searching, consumers yearned for what they lost, spoke of experiencing anxiety, frustration, and sadness, and began searching for alternate ways to get back what was lost. In the third stage, Despair & Disorganization, participants reported feelings of anger, despair, and hopelessness while the initial acceptance of the loss brought the need to withdraw from shopping activities once enjoyed. Evidence of the fourth and final stage, Reorganization and Recovery, in which participants reflect on the new-normal, during which  intense feelings, such as anger and sadness begin to subside, and fond memories of past shopping experiences surface. The findings open new avenues for thinking about how trait- like consumer variables like the need for touch may be more malleable than previously sought, especially as a result of traumatic experiences.
