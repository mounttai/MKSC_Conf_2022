1 - Rethinking Product Display Francisco Cisternas Vera, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Wee Chaimanowong Decisions on product display have a strong influence on product demand. Desirable locations are well understood but competition effects are often overlooked. Intuitively, products located next to each other are more likely to compete. Specifically, relatively strong products draw demand from other products, and this effect is stronger for those in close proximity.When demand interactions are considered across the whole display are considered problem becomes NP-hard. In this work, we consider a model that allows correlations in demand upon the relative attractiveness of competing products moderated by their proximity and has been shown to outperform traditional models in fit and predictive power based on experimental data from physical retail stores. The resulting problem of maximizing profit based on this model is interesting in its own right as a non-linear integer programming problem. We explore various problem transformation, approximation techniques and exact solution to provide manager with general guidelines and suggestion to improve their own specific displays.
