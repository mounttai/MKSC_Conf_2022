3 - Leaving Money on their Smartphones: Comparing uses of Promotional Codes Between Mobile and PC Shoppers Rebecca Jen-Hui Wang, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA , Mathew Isaac Are customers more or less likely to use promotional coupon codes when they shop with their smartphones? In an e-commerce setting, a retailer can offer customers discounts that require them to input a promotional coupon code upon checking out and transacting the order, e.g., enter 5OffHolidays for $5 off. In this multi-method paper, we examine whether customers use coupon codes when they shop online using smartphones compared to when they use devices with larger screens, such as PCs. We first empirically perform a series of analyses using causal inference, machine learning, and econometric models with a large proprietary dataset from an Internet-based grocery retailer. We find that customers are more likely to use coupon codes when they shop using PCs as opposed to smartphones. We replicate the findings in a more controlled setting with two experiments, and we posit that customers are less likely to enter promotional codes while shopping on smartphones because perceived search effort is higher when operating on a small screen. Combining primary and secondary research, we make contributions in both retail and mobile marketing literature. Conceptually, we propose that search effort and perceived cognitive load play an essential role in uses of online coupons. Managerially, we recommend that an online retailer should tailor different types of promotional offerings depending on its customersâ€™ channel preference.
