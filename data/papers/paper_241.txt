3 - Multi-dimensional Salesforce Compensation with Negotiated Prices Minkyung Kim, UNC Chapel Hill Kenan-Flagler Business School, Chapel Hill, NC Pranav Jindal, Peter Newberry In many settings where pricing is delegated to salespeople, firms provide the salespeople incentivesto not only sell more, but also to do so at higher prices. In this paper, we study the relativeimportance of pricing-focused and revenue- focused incentives, and quantify the profitability ofdifferent designs for the pricing-focused incentives. Utilizing data from a large durable goodsretailer in the U.S., we outline and estimate a structural model of multitasking salesforce wherea salesperson jointly makes selling and negotiation decisions for multiple product types. Wefind that the disutility from negotiating varies by product type, and is comparable to that fromselling. Eliminating pricing-focused (revenue- focused) incentives, while making the salespersonindifferent, lowers the retailer’s profit by 11% (10%) pointing to the  relative importance ofpricing-focused incentives. Additionally, eliminating different features of pricing-focused incentives which vary in whether they incentivize salespeople to sell at higher or lower markups,result in lower profits for the retailer. These results are driven by (i) the possibility that effortsin selling and negotiating can either be substitutes due to effort cost considerations or complementsbecause of the demand response to change in prices, and (ii) the salesperson’s ability toreallocate efforts across product types in response to changes in the compensation scheme.
