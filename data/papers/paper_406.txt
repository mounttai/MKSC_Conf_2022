4 - Frugality Versus Thrifty: The Gender Difference in Saving Behavior Alex Yao, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA Ying Bao, Maria Rodas, Chen Gong This research focuses on how gender shapes people’s saving behaviors - namely, frugality or thriftiness - by leveraging a unique dataset from a major social media platform. By analyzing people’s posts on social media using machine learning algorithms to classify different behaviors, our results suggest that males tend to be more frugal, as they are more anti-consumption focused and their saving behaviors are often related to DIY, homemade, and meal prep; while females tend to be thriftier, as they are more pro-consumption  focused and save through collecting coupons, sales, and discount information. Moreover, in terms of the topics or items people cuttings budget on, we also see a clear gender difference by using textual analysis. In particular, we find the males tend to focus more on necessary products, such as food; while females tend to focus more on discretionary products, such as personal care. We supplement our analysis with an experiment to show the generalization across different cultures and explore the underlying mechanism of the study. Our findings highlight how sellers can use marketing communications to increase the salience of the product features such as long lifetime or deep discount.
