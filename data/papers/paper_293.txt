4 - Climate Labeling Policy and Consumer Choice Sakshi Babar, University of Georgia, Athens, GA Youngtak M. Kim, Sundar G Bharadwaj With the growing concern about climate change and its consequences for societal well-being, countries and firms are involved in climate actions aimed at reducing the carbon footprint. Firms appear to be following a two pronged strategy of reducing resource use in their manufacturing and distribution of products and at the same time, encouraging consumers to make choices that reduce the carbon footprint. While still in early stages some firms are incorporating carbon footprint information in their product labels. Surveys of consumers indicate that over 50% pay attention to information on the CO2 emissions of products, especially in the cases of food and cosmetics. However, academic research on whether consumers respond to these labels is limited. This study presents results of choice based conjoint studies that examine the effect of carbon footprint information and labeling regimes on products consumers choose. We also examine the moderating role of consumer knowledge and orientation towards environmental issues. The results have implications for firm marketing strategy and regulatory guidelines on product labels.
