5 - Incentivized Peer Referrals in Health: Field Experiment Evidence from Zambia During Covid Pradeep Chintagunta, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL In this paper, we report the results of a randomized controlled trial conducted in Zambia to study whether peer networks can be leveraged to promote the spread of in-formation about COVID-19 preventive behaviors using available technology (basic cellphones). Specifically, we tested whether individuals can be encouraged or incentivized to forward SMSs with their contacts, whether such messages have an effect on the recipients’ behavior, and whether effects depend on the sender (government health authority or part of one’s peer network).
