3 - Friend or Foe: The Impact of Video UGC on Video Game Sales and Usage Jinhee Huh, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada Lingling Zhang, Pallassana K Kannan Consumers increasingly use online videos to share experiences about products. Compared with text-based content, user-generated video (UGV) content is more visual and auditory and thus can be more engaging. However, it runs the risk of spoiling the consumption experience, especially for information goods. In this research, we examine the impact of UGVs on sales and usage for online video games. We compile a unique and comprehensive data set from multiple sources and specify a dynamic panel data model to estimate the heterogeneous effects of UGVs. Our results indicate that UGVs by popular influencers have a positive impact on sales and the effect is stronger for games from small developers; however, such positive effect dissipates post purchase. In contrast, UGVs by less popular influencers hurt non-strategy game sales and usage. With an affective content analysis, we demonstrate how UGVs from influencers of different popularity levels differ in their audio and visual features, which further affect viewersâ€™ responses. Our findings have managerial implications for the video-game industry. Video-game developers can use our research to determine the appropriate policies on whether and how UGVs can be uploaded, promoted, and monetized.
