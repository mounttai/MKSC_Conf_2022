3 - Drivers and the Financial Consequence of Digital Transformation Chun-Yao Huang, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan Yen-Chun Chen, Ping-Yu Liu Digital transformation has been a critical challenge to market players during the past few years. Facing changes in technological environment, which factors determine the success of a firm’s digital transformation is an important but understudied question. In this study, we look at how a firm’s strategic orientations (customer orientations and entrepreneurial orientation) influence its degree of digital transformation through the mediation of its environmental sensing capability, and investigate the impact of a firm’s degree of digital transformation on its financial performance. A set of hypotheses are first proposed. Resorting to the technique of computer aided text analysis (CATA) to measure constructs of concern from the MD&A components of annual reports, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on publicly- listed firms to validate the set of hypotheses. A comparison is also made between firms listed in the States and those in China. As such, we empirically validate that a firm’s strategic orientations influence its capability of environment sensing, which in turn influences its degree of digital transformation. Furthermore, we partially demonstrate that digital transformation would contribute to a firm’s financial performance as measured by ROA growth.
