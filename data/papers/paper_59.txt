1 - An Information-Processing Theory of Loss Aversion J. Miguel Villas-Boas, University of California, Berkeley, CA This paper considers a model where a risk-neutral decision- maker receives both a signal about whether an outcome is above a certain threshold (a reference point) and a signal on the value of the outcome. Given these two signals, the expected value function of the outcome exhibits diminishing sensitivities both above and below the reference point. Furthermore, in the examples considered loss aversion occurs if the reference point is not too high. The paper shows how the informativeness of each signal affects the declining sensitivities and loss aversion effects, and reduces to risk-neutral decision-making when the signal on the value of outcome is perfectly informative. The loss aversion effects occur for low reference points because of the signal on the value of the outcome, and because the decision-maker may pay greater attention to the less likely low outcomes.
