3 - Balancing User Privacy With Predictive Insights in Mobile Location Data David A Schweidel, Emory University, Atlanta, GA Tal Shoshani, Peter Pal Zubcsek Mobile location data offers granular detail into consumersâ€™ mobility patterns. The detailed nature of the data, however, can reveal sensitive information about consumers based on the places that they visit, such as healthcare facilities, social connections or educational institutions.

In our empirical context, we find that some level of aggregation results in higher predictive accuracy.
