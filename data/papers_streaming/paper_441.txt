4 - Beyond Influencers: Impacts of Viewer Herd Behaviors and Sales Assortment on Performance of Livestream Events Ming Cheng, Suffolk University, Boston, MA Jane Zhu, Quan Jin Digital transformation in marketing has profoundly changed the way how brands communicate and interact with customers. Livestream sales events that are hosted by social media influencers and conducted via major social media/e- commerce sites to introduce, recommend a wide variety of  product and service offerings have emerged and become a new digital promotion paradigm (e.g., Amazon Live, TikTok). The idea of integrating social media interactivity between influencers and audiences into an online sales event has turned out to be a popular and successful business model, particularly for companies with focuses in selling intangible, hedonic, and experience-driven offerings. Drawing from social media influencer and assortment choice literature, we hypothesize that the social impact, as it is exemplified by crowd or herd behaviors in livestream events (e.g., customer’s sentiment through likes, comments in a livestream event) could play an important role in influencing a consumer’s purchase decision and subsequently, affecting the sales performance of the brands and the influencer. Additionally, we hypothesize that the herd impact could play a stronger impact on consumer purchase decision, especially when decisions that are difficult to justify (e.g., hedonic or service offerings).To empirically test our conceptual framework, we collected a unique secondary dataset from a leading livestream host platform based in China. We employ regression models to test our hypotheses at 1) individual product sales performance and 2) social media influencer fan base growth levels. Empirically, we discovered that, in general, a larger number of likes that a viewer crowd generates during an event contributes to more purchases of individual items promoted at the event. Additionally, herd behaviors have positive impact on hedonic rather than utilitarian offerings, particularly when the assortment size is small. Our empirical findings provide important implications to brand managers and social media influencers.
