2 - Regulating Environmental Impacts from Planned Obsolescence Man Xie, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ Tianxin Zou Many firms exercise planned obsolescence, deliberately reducing product durability to encourage new product purchases in the future, which generates unnecessary wastes and environmental damages. Policymakers have attempted to address the problem with several methods, including charging environmental taxes, investing in reducing product environmental footprints, educating consumers’ environmental awareness, etc. Our paper analyzes how the regulation influences the firm’s planned obsolescence decisions, the environmental damage, and the social welfare. We show that the regulations can sometimes unintendedly exacerbate the level of planned obsolescence, which can potentially harm the society.
