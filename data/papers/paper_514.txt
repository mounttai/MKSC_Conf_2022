4 - Goodbye My Friends and Goodbye My Career: Evidence from the Movie Industry Xinlong Li, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore Andrew Ching When managers need to put together a team, does referral/ information spillover via candidates’ network matter? This is a challenging empirical question because one’s network is endogenous and a function of his/her ability. By analyzing over 180,000 professional teams in the movie industry (actors, directors, and producers) spanning 20 years, we provide evidence that network connections play a potentially important role in affecting actor’s likelihood to be hired. Our identification strategy relies on the exogeneous death happened to some producers and directors, and its impact on the actors/actresses who are connected with them. Following the death of a producer/director, we find that, on average, actors/actresses who have worked with him/her before have a 6.95% decline in their future acting opportunities. The results are robust for quality-adjusted movies. By examining the interactions of the treatment effect with actor, producer and director characteristics, we consider several plausible mechanisms that might explain this finding. Our results indicate that referral/information spillover is the most likely driving force. We also find that more experienced actors/ actresses are less affected by the loss of connections, and actresses suffer more from these death shocks than their male counterparts.
