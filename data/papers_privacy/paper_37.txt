1 - Regulatory Spillovers and Data Governance: Evidence from the GDPR Michail Batikas, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany Christian Peukert, Tobias Kretschmer, Stefan Bechtold We document short-run changes in websites and the web technology industry with the introduction of the GDPR. We follow more than 110,000 websites for twelve months before and six months after the GDPR became effective and show that websites substantially reduced their interactions with web technology providers. We further document an increase in market concentration in web technology services. Our findings contribute to the discussion on how regulating privacy impacts data minimization, competition, and market structure.
