2 - The Impact of Political Ideology on Consumers’ Reactions to Hotels’ Donations of Rooms Sohyun Bae, Assistant Professor, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the remarkable corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities that many hotels have engaged in has been providing unsold rooms to people in need (e.g., frontline medical professionals and homeless people). However, not much research has been conducted to examine what factors influence consumers’ reactions to hotels’ donations of rooms. To fill that gap, in this research we propose that consumers’ political ideology (i.e., conservative vs. liberal) affects their attitudes toward hotels that have donated rooms to homeless people versus medical professionals. Through three experiments, we found that conservative participants showed less positive attitudes (e.g., lower willingness to stay) toward hotels that had donated rooms to homeless people than liberal counterparts because they felt more disgust toward those hotels. However, there was no difference in attitudes between conservative and liberal participants when a hotel had donated rooms to medical professionals. We further found that hotel type (i.e., luxury vs. non-luxury) moderates the effect of political ideology on consumers’ attitudes toward hotels that have donated rooms to homeless people. This research provides valuable insights for marketing managers in the hotel industry and policy makers about how to design more effective room donation campaigns during the pandemic.
