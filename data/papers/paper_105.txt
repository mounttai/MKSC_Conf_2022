4 - Leveraging Gaussian Processes for Counterfactual Inference in One-shot Field Experiments: Evidence from a Large-scale Donation Drive Kee Yeun Lee, UNIST, Ulsan, Korea, Republic of , Gwen Ahn, Fred M Feinberg, Arnaud De Bruyn Numeric scales are ubiquitous throughout social science and economics. For charities, specifically, appeals scales (specific amounts from which donors can choose) are standard solicitation tools. Isolating their effects on actual downstream donor behavior - whether (incidence) and how much (amount) to give - is bedeviled by uncontrollable self-selection and endogeneity effects that hinder optimal individual-level scale design. Our data stem from a fully randomized field experiment that orthogonalized major components of the appeals scales - minima, maxima and pace of increase - for over 50,000 donors of a large national charity. Assessing the effectiveness of both manipulations, as well as consequent optimization, requires individual-level counterfactuals. To this end we develop a hierarchical multi-output Gaussian Process (GP) model that jointly accounts for donation incidence and amount while incorporating donor heterogeneity. The GP nonparametrically “smooths” over each donor’s history while leveraging the full corpus of data to provide joint posteriors for treatment effects on both incidence and amount, and consequently overall expected donation gain. This in turn allows the charity to better tailor individual appeals scales and request timing for subsequent donation drives. Thursday, 11:30am–12:30pm
