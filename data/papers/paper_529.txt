2 - Competition Between Branded vs. Generic Prescription Drugs: Theory and Evidence Jung-Chae Suh, Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of Drawing on Rochet & Stole (2002), we developed a theoretical model of dynamic nature (i.e., the two period and multi-periods). In order to find the price and brand effects we used structural estimation with an ethical drug category before and after a dominant generic drug’s patent expiration. We also dealt with market definition issues in quantifying the consumer welfare effects of generics’ entry. Further, we ran a counterfactual analysis for quantifying the value of earlier or later patent expiration due to deals (or possibly called collusion) between the patented brand drug and (the first) generic drug. We suggested managerial and policy implications for law and economics (for regulators and legal experts).
