4 - Brand Generated Emotional Content in Social Networks Begum Sener, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey Berk Ataman, Ezgi Akpinar With the ever-increasing competition for attention in social media, generating engagement with branded content posts has become harder. A large body of research exploring how to effectively communicate with the consumers through social media channels has highlighted the importance of  emotional content and offered insights as to which emotions generate greater engagement and why. Yet, surprisingly few studies have investigated the effect of the emotional state of the consumers. Provided that social media content is not consumed in a vacuum, the current paper examines consumers’ reactions to brand-generated emotion-laden social media content conditional on their emotional states. To that end, the authors combine three sources of data comprising a large sample of user-generated social media posts, brand-generated social media posts from 359 FMCG companies, and a field study to represent emotions as their corresponding underlying dimensions. The results show that (1) the arousal level of consumers’ emotional state drives engagement even in the absence of emotions in brand-generated content and (2) the ability of an emotion in brand-generated content to increase engagement depends heavily on where it stands in relation to the consumers’ emotional states on all underlying dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance. This study highlights the importance of contextual elements in consumer engagement and offers managerial insights on how to create effective social media campaigns.
