1 - Search Routes in Mobile Commerce Luna Zhang, University of Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, WA Elisabeth Honka, Yuliang Yao, Raluca Ursu When shopping online for a product, consumers can reach a product list page via multiple routes: by going through a category page, by directly typing the product name in the search field, by going through a sale page, etc. Previous research has largely ignored how consumers choose between these routes and how, in turn, these routes affect which products consumers subsequently see, browse, and potentially purchase. Our novel data from a mobile shopping app contain detailed information on consumer browsing for sandals throughout the app over a time period of six months. We use an adapted version of the theoretical Greminger (2021) model to empirically examine how consumers choose a search route and how this choice affects browsing and purchase decisions.
