1 - Blessing or Curse: The Role of Traditional Advertising on Promoting Internet-based Donation Campaigns Yashar Dehdashti, Texas Wesleyan University, Fort Worth, TX Aidin Namin Current methods of creating awareness about online crowdfunded donation campaigns are mostly limited to online tools (e.g., sharing, tweeting, and so on). The news media have recently begun to share the news about some of these campaigns that have been deemed newsworthy (e.g., the Orlando shooting, Flint water crisis, etc.). Since the aim of this research is to measure the effect of an intervention (treatment) using secondary data, one might argue that other factors besides the treatment produce the results; a problem which is easily addresses in experimental settings through randomization. Propensity-score matching (PSM) is used to address this issue. Given a number of observable characteristics of the donation campaigns, propensity scores are estimated and closest observations are matched and compared (nearest neighbor method). Consistent with the literature on news media coverage, this study finds that campaigns that are shared on both the social media and news media do significantly better than those that are merely shared on the social media. This particular context (online donation campaigns) has never been studied. This analysis has important implications for raising awareness about online donation campaigns.
