3 - A Structural Life Course Model of Dynamic Role Selection for a Q & A Platform for Pregnancy and Childbirth Masakazu Ishihara, New York University, New York, NY Hiroshi Kumakura  The success of Q&A platforms depends largely on how quickly users can obtain answers for their questions, which in turn depends on the pool of users who can provide answers. Often, users in the pool are those who acquired knowledge from other users on the platform. Thus, to maintain active interactions among users, it is important for Q&A platforms to motivate users who acquired knowledge from the platform to respond quickly to the questions posted by other users. This paper investigates this issue in a popular Q&A platform for pregnancy and childbirth in Japan, where many users who are pregnant for the first time engage in both asking and answering questions as their knowledge and experiences evolve over the course of pregnancy. We first propose a structural model of two-sided markets where users endogenously choose which side to participate based on the issues they face and their evolving knowledge set. We then collect data for all the questions and answers posted on the website between Jan. 2019 and Jul. 2021. To evaluate the issues asked by users on the platform, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation and classify questions into 100 interpretable topics. We find that different issues arise at different points during pregnancy. We then estimate the proposed model using data from first-time pregnancy users. Our finding suggests that users who obtained more answers to their past questions are more likely to provide an answer in the future. Using the structural estimates, we run a counterfactual experiment where we increase the probability of matching a question with users who have the knowledge to answer by 1% and evaluate its impact on the number of answers. We find that on average, the number of answers increases by 2.3%, and this impact varies across topics.
