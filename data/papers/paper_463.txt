3 - Which Consumer Reviews are More Influential: The Effects of Friendship and Home Bias on Subsequent Reviews Ruoding Wang, Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Eunsoo Kim, Xinlong Li Online consumer review (OCR) is an important source of product information. With the widespread practice of OCR platforms presenting reviews from friends along with consumer location information, we investigate how prior reviews from friends affect the contents of subsequent reviews and whether home bias exists in the review contents. Leveraging Yelp review data from 118 cities in North America between 2006 and 2018, we employ a Na√Øve Bayes algorithm and hybrid matching method that combines propensity score matching (PSM) and Mahalanobis distance matching to estimate the friendship and home bias effect on the content similarity. The approach is taken to resolve the endogeneity problem that similarity among review contents from friends or reviewers from the same city can be attributed to commonalities among friends or consumers from the same city. This study shows superior performance of the hybrid matching method compared to the Mahalanobis distance matching and the PSM respectively. We find that subsequent review contents converge to the review contents from friends for a given restaurant. By estimating a causal forest, we show that reviews from certain types of users are prone to home bias. This research expands the social influence literature on the contents of online reviews and provides insight to OCR management.
