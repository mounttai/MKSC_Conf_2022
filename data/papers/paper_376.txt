2 - Should Firms Reward Referring Customers Based on the Performance of Each Referred Customer? Yupeng Chen, Assistant Professor of Marketing, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Bowen Lou Referral programs have been widely adopted by firms for new customer acquisition. In most referral programs, the reward that a referring customer receives is only contingent on the acquisition of each of his referred customers. While such an acquisition-based referral reward provides current customers an incentive to make referrals, it may not be effective in generating referrals that acquire high-value new customers. To improve the outcomes of referral programs, we propose that firms can consider rewarding a referring customer based on the short-term performance of each of his referred customers, in addition to offering the standard acquisition-based referral reward. We empirically tested the effect of our proposed performance-based referral reward by conducting a large-scale randomized field experiment in collaboration with a Chinese online financial services firm. Analyzing data from the experiment, we find that offering a moderate performance-based referral reward increased the total value of new customers acquired through the referral program by more than 110%, and this effect is primarily driven by the acquisition of higher-value new customers instead of more new customers. We propose two mechanisms to explain how the performance-based referral reward helped the firm acquire higher-value new customers, including (1) by motivating current customers to screen their friends and refer good matches to the firm, and (2) by offering referred customers an additional incentive to invest. The data provide support for both mechanisms.
