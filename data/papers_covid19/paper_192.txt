3 - COVID-19 Morbidity Information Disclosure Format and Levels: Impact on Compliance with Recommended Preventive Behaviors Angela Yi, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA Dipankar Chakravarti Coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic has varied by media outlets. Some outlets presented infection and morbidity information both as frequencies and percentages, whereas others reported only the frequency information. Moreover, information disclosure level also varied: some outlets selectively reported only the infections and deaths data, whereas others have provided breakdowns of the infections data by severity (recoveries) and deaths. These seemingly innocuous differences in morbidity information disclosure formats and levels may have had different effects on people’s judgments of the pandemic’s severity and their health concerns (for themselves and family members). This in turn may have affected their compliance intentions with recommended preventive behaviors (RPBs). We also examine whether these effects are moderated by individuals’ socio-economic ideology (i.e., self-perceptions as liberal/conservative on social vs. fiscal dimensions). A web experiment examined these issues using a 2 (format: frequency; frequency and percentage) x 3 (level: tested positive, deaths; tested positive, deaths, recoveries, still sick cases; tested positive, deaths, recoveries, still sick cases, infection severity) design. Participants (327 MTurk workers) rated their compliance likelihood with four RPBs (social distancing, mask wearing, self-quarantine and lockdown). We also measured participants’ social-fiscal ideology, and the extent to which their compliance motivation was to protect themselves versus others. Results show that information format presenting frequencies and percentages (vs. frequency alone), lowered health concern judgments. Lower health concerns mediated lower compliance with the RPBs. Self-reported social-fiscal ideology moderated the effect for some RPBs.
