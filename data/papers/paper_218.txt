4 - The Effect of Gender Stereotypes in Voice Shopping Lea Sollfrank, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany Ju-Young Kim Voice-assisted commerce is on the rise. The underlying shopping process requires a voice-based interaction between user and assistant, which takes place with either a female or male voice assistant. It is unclear, however, how users perceive different genders of the assistant and thereupon evaluate the recommendation of the assistant. This evaluation may differ depending on the gender of the participant, the gender of the recommended product and the certainty the user has in the respective product segment. Drawing on levels of the self-categorization theory and the CASA paradigm as well as literature on gender stereotypes  in an AI context, we examine in two online experiments the impact of the participant’s gender, the product gender and the assistant’s gender on both perceptual measures (i.e. competence and trustworthiness) and behavioural measures (i.e. actively requesting help from the assistant and product choice). We expect from the results that lower certainty in the product segment will lead to increased consultation of the assistant and possible rescheduling of the product choice. We anticipate this to be particularly the case for a mismatch between participant and product gender and a match between product and assistant gender. We attribute the results in these settings to higher perceived competence and trustworthiness of the assistant. Preliminary findings show, that a lower certainty in the product segment as expected leads to a higher probability to consult the assistant as well as to a variation in the final product choice. They further indicate that a match-up between product and assistant gender can lead to higher perceived competence and trustworthiness of the assistant.
