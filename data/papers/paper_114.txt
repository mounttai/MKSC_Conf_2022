2 - How to Incentivize Sales Managers: Evidence From a Field Study Aritra Bhattacharya, PhD Student, Indian School of Business, Mohali, India Raghu Bommaraju, Robert Waiser The importance of suitable incentive contracts to motivate sales employees is well understood. Existing literature in sales marketing focuses on the incentive structure of sales representatives to characterize an optimal plan. However, there is little theoretical and empirical work on sales managers’ incentives. We investigate whether sales managers should be compensated based on the cumulative target achievement of their salespeople or based on the number of salespeople achieving their individual targets. While the former is the most used in firms, this could create two potential issues. First, managers may focus on top- performing salespeople and ignore poor performers. Second, while the former approach helps maximize revenues in the short run, the latter can help bring territory balance that can aid in the firm’s long-term performance. We rely on a quasi-experiment to understand the effectiveness of the latter approach. Our data consists of 137 sales territories under 54 managers of a pharmaceutical firm in India across two years. The results indicate that incentivizing sales managers based on the number of salespeople achieving their individual targets is more effective than incentivizing managers based on cumulative target achievement. We further examine the moderating effect of territory type and salespeople’s past performance.
