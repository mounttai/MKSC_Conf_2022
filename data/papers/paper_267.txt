2 - Persistence of Consumer Lifestyle Choices: Evidence from Restaurant Delivery During COVID-19 Daniel M McCarthy, Emory University, Atlanta, GA We study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer purchasing behavior in the restaurant delivery category in the and, particularly, the extent to which pandemic-driven shocks to purchasing behavior have persisted even as consumers’ lifestyles are returning to a new normal. We apply age-period-cohort (APC) models, commonly used in sociology but with limited adoption in marketing, to nonparametrically decompose customer behavior into acquisition cohort, tenure, and calendar time effects. This approach, in conjunction with an event study approach, allows us to flexibly estimate the time-varying effects of ubiquitous events such as COVID, where no contemporaneous control group is available, by comparing the behavior of cohorts acquired at different times. We estimate that pandemic- related disruptions initially more than doubled customers’ aggregate spending. As of Summer 2021, the lift in sales was still approximately one-third of its early pandemic peak, despite evidence that the pandemic-driven shocks driving the initial lift had abated, due to a sizeable segment of customers continuing to purchase at elevated rates. This persistent behavior is consistent with some consumers having formed habits around delivery. However, this persistence appears to gradually decay over time, suggesting that habits acquired during COVID may not last indefinitely.
