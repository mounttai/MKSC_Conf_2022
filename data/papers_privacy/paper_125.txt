1 - Does Social Media Participation Benefit Product Content Generation? Evidence from a Social Media Shutdown Sihan Fang, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore Siliang Tong, Yingjie Zhang, Junhong Chu, Zhijie Lin  Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment of an unexpected shutdown of a social media channel in a large social marketplace, we investigate how individual sellers’ social media participation affects their motivation in product listing and their efforts in product content generation. Empirical results demonstrate that the shutdown leads to a lower likelihood of sellers posting a resale product and fewer product listings, suggesting that sellers might have a lower resale motivation. One plausible explanation is that social media participation helps reduce sellers’ hassle cost of product resale as it provides social support and resale inspiration. Text mining analyses of product descriptions provide evidence to support the proposed cost reduction mechanism of social media participation. The results show that sellers create product content with a lower level of usefulness (i.e., shorter and less concrete product description) and fewer sentiment expressions (i.e., applying fewer positive sentiments and emotions), indicating that the increased hassle cost reduces the level of elaboration in content generation after the social media shutdown. In addition, the identified effect is more salient for sellers who are less familiar with the resale process (i.e., have less resale experience in the marketplace) or more sensitive to the hassle cost (i.e., have a fulltime occupation). The paper offers important implications for social marketplace managers in promoting seller product content generation and driving supply growth.
