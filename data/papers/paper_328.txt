4 - A Consumer-centric Framework for Firearms Regulation Sarah Moshary, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL Bradley T. Shapiro, Sara Drango This paper estimates consumer demand for firearms with the purpose of evaluating the likely impacts of firearm regulations. We first conduct a stated-choice-based conjoint analysis and estimate an individual level demand model for firearms. We validate our estimates using aggregate moments from observational data. Next, we use our estimates to simulate changes in the number and types of guns in circulation under alternative regulations. Importantly, we find that bans or restrictions that specifically target assault weapons increase demand for handguns, which are associated with the vast majority of firearm-related violence.  We also find that the consumer surplus associated with firearm purchase is sufficiently high that an outright ban on firearms may be infeasible both politically and economically.
