1 - Dynamic Triggering Effects for Online Content: A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach Yang Li, Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business (CKGSB), Beijing, 100738, China, yangli@ckgsb.edu.cn Jinnan Huang, Jiapeng Liu, Xiuwu Liao Internet users exhibit diverse and evolving interest in online content creation (e.g., post and comment) and consumption (e.g., read, upvote, and repost). Earlier discussion of certain topics may trigger discussion of other topics in the near future. To understand the evolving mutual influences between different user-generated contents over time, we develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric topic model that integrates mutually exciting point processes (MEPP) with Indian buffet processes (IBP). While the MEPP considers the presence of topics as dependent stochastic events in continuous time, the nonparametric IBP flexibly accommodates diverse latent triggering factors within the MEPP. We apply the integrated model to content data collected from Quora, a well-known  online Q&A community, where new topics are often follow- ups of previous discussion. We use sequential Monte Carlo to efficiently estimate the nonparametric model. The results show that our proposed model can not only produce meaningful topics, but also uncover dynamic triggering patterns between topics over time.
