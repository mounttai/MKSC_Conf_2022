1 - Name Stereotyping in the Gig Economy Dalal Ahmad, Kuwait University, Shedadiah, Kuwait The emergence of the Internet as a tool in the hiring process for gig workers has shifted the job market paradigm. Many observers have welcomed the advent of online labor platforms as a way for workers to gain fairer access to job  opportunities, and achieve wage equality. Workers, they assumed, would be free to compete for gigs around the world based solely on their qualifications rather than their locations, race, gender, and other non-productivity-based characteristics. In this research, we look at the effect of workersâ€™ stereotypical names on pay disparity using data collected from an online hiring platform. We use propensity score matching to provide covariate balance for workers having stereotypical and non-stereotypical names. We also discuss the managerial implications, and provide insights for pay discrepancy in the gig economy.
