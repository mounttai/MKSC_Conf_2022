2 - Brands that use BAE: Does Slang Help Brands? Bryce Pyrah, PhD Candidate, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA Alice Wang With the popularity of social media, many brands use slang in their marketing communications to connect with their consumers on a personal level. Across five experiments, we find that the use of slang in marketing communications could have unintended negative consequences for brands. Brand messages tend to exhibit higher levels of formality and authority than consumer messages. Hence, the expectations consumers have for brand messages make the use of slang inappropriate in brand communications. However, these  expectations are relaxed for consumer messages, making the use of slang acceptable in consumer communications. As a result, brand messages containing slang lead to less favorable brand attitudes and behaviors, whereas the same messages sent by consumers do not have such negative consequences. To further test our theory on expectancy violations as the mediator, we operationalized consumer expectations with brand personality. We show that, in messages from brands with a sincere personality, slang results in less favorable attitudes. However, when brands with an exciting personality use slang, the negative effect on brand attitudes disappears because consumers do not have the same expectations for brands that are exciting and rebellious.
