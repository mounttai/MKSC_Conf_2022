2 - Heterogeneity in Patient Adoption and Usage of Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic Weijia (Daisy) Dai, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN Siyun Lv, Qiang Liu, Yong Cai Telehealth visits increased rapidly at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak as healthcare providers across the US rushed to enable telehealth services to limit virus exposure. Telehealth played a critical role in the continuation of care for the most vulnerable patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the adoption of telehealth in preventing care disruption varied widely across different providers and demographic groups. Furthermore, telehealth utilization dropped sharply when pandemic pressure eased despite its wide accessibility spurred by hospital adoptions. In this paper, we estimate how the hospital adoption of telehealth affects patient utilization over time and how the effect is moderated by pandemic severity, lock-down policies, patient demographics, and hospital attributes. We use IQVIA Medical Claims (Dx) data built on a panel of patients. Our data consists of 75 million in-person and online medical visits treating breast cancer  and schizophrenia between January 2018 and October 2021 at the largest 10,000 health care organizations. By assessing the heterogeneous take-up and usage of telehealth among patients, we derive insights into the most valuable areas of telehealth applications.
