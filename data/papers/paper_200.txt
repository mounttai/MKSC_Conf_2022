3 - AI and AI-human Based Screening and Selection for Salesperson Hiring Using Interview Videos Ishita Sunity Chakraborty, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI Khai Chiong, Howard Dover, K Sudhir We consider the problem of AI and AI-human based screening (eliminating bottom candidates) and selection (hiring top candidates) in salesforce hiring. Using videos  of structured interviews of candidates and ratings from multiple recruiting experts on standard performance criteria, we develop an AI model of salesforce ``skill’’ prediction by extracting theory-relevant objective measures of interviewee performance embedded in videos. Using the model, we address two issues: First, to aid interpretability of the AI model, we assess what mode of unstructured data from the interview (text, audio and video information) and what specific behaviors (e.g, body language, conversation style) drive AI predictions of salesperson skill. We find that while initial screening decisions are heavily impacted by audio-visual features like ``energetic voice, final selection decision relies more heavily on linguistic features like being precise and quantitative. We also find that optimal amount of `interactivity in conversations’’ (i.e., frequency of turns in conversation between buyer and seller) and ``willingness to listen’’ (share of buyer speaking time) is an important determinant of high ratings. Second, we use a Bayesian approach to combine AI prediction with human judgment to assess improvements in predictive performance of the hybrid AI-human model with respect to a pure human panel benchmark. Augmenting AI with human judgment has limited benefit for screening but improves selection significantly. Further, human judgment based on the first 2-3 minutes of the interaction is sufficient. This suggests a cost-effective way to deploy AI in sales hiring- --use AI exclusively for screening but augment it with human judgment based on early stages of interview for selection. Friday, 9–10am
