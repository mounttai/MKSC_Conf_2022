2 - Searching for Rewards Xu Zhu, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong T. Tony Ke Reward program is a commonplace in many markets. It allows enrolled members to receive rewards based on their past purchases and redeem these rewards for future purchase. Based on a repeated ordered search framework, we propose a new theory for reward programs in a frictional market. Consumers search for product information sequentially over many firms, each of which offers two independent products in two periods. Consumers make a purchase from one firm in each period. We find that firms use both price discounts and rewards to attract consumers, where price discounts deter consumers from continuing to search other firms in the current shopping trip, while rewards enable the firm to gain prominence in consumersâ€™ next shopping trip. Consequently, as the search cost gets higher, firms offer lower price discounts but higher rewards. Overall, reward programs always decrease industry profit and raise/reduce consumer surplus when the search cost is high/low.
