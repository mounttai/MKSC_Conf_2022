1 - Marketing to Rationally Inattentive Customers Andrew Caplin, New York University, New York, NY We develop a simple, dynamic model of market share that highlights interactions between social learning and private attentional choice. The key role of social learning in our model is to guide buyers not only on how much total attention to allocate to each decision, but also on precisely how to divide this attention up in an optimal manner. We show that allowing the agents the opportunity to gather information selectively after observing market behavior has a fundamental effect on individual learning and on the resulting market dynamics. In terms of marketing applications, the key point is that an outside observer with access to suitably rich data on market shares may be better able to understand preferences than are decision makers themselves. Agents in the model are learning optimally given their limited resources. They focus their attention on matters that concern them directly, but their powers are limited. One could imagine that a large agent, such as the government, Google, Amazon, or a market research firm such as J. D. Power and Associates or Consumer Reports, might have greater access to large amounts of detailed choice data as well as greater incentives process this information. Governments and research firms collect a broad range of statistics. Google sees the search behavior of a large fraction of agents. Amazon directly observes consumer choice. In this era of big data we show how such an agent might be able to put together detailed market data and might be able to learn type-dependent preferences.
