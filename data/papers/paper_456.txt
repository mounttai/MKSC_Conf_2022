2 - Modeling the Short vs. Long-run Dynamics of Variety-seeking vs. Inertial Preferences for Experiential Products Liangbin Yang, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY Joy Lu Existing models that capture variety-seeking vs. inertial consumption behaviors often assume that these behaviors are time-invariant and donâ€™t change throughout the consumption journey. We relax this assumption and develop a novel model that flexibly allows variety-seeking and inertial behavior to be time-varying and differ in the short vs. long run, and apply our model to data on a large set of players of an online video game. For example, a player may exhibit inertial preferences by choosing to play the same game options (e.g., a map environment, game objective) persistently in the short run, but exhibit variety-seeking by switching among different options in the long run. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that a significant proportion of players exhibit different variety-seeking and inertial behavior in the short and long run. We further show that allowing time-varying preferences can reduce biases in predicting player preferences, as well as improve the explanatory and predictive power on playing behaviors.
