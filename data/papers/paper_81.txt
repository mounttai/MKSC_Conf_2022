2 - Uncovering Successful Narratives in Super Bowl Ads Jongho Kim, PhD Student, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY Khaled Boughanmi, Young-Hoon Park Developing original and creative advertising is considered an art rather than a science. In this research, the authors propose a new framework to examine the impact of advertising narratives on advertising success. The framework consists of three steps: (1) dividing a narrative of advertising into a sequence of textual components, (2) identifying interpretable topics of the components using an Embedded Topic Model approach, and (3) assessing the impact of topical variations on advertising success. The authors illustrate the framework using a dataset on Super Bowl ads spanning a period of ten years. The findings highlight the importance of topical variations to advertising success and their heterogeneous effects across different industries. The authors discuss the implications on designing successful advertising narratives.
