1 - Empirical Analysis on Household Food Carbon Footprint using Homescan Data Lu Yan, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN Ting Zhu, Li Song Global warming can be overwhelming, and shopping choices in day-to-day life can intensify or lessen the householdâ€™s impact on the environment. What to eat and where to purchase food influence the household food carbon footprint together. We examine whether and why shopping at the warehouse club stores affects household food carbon footprint. Using the process-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) model and Nielsen Consumer Panel data, we calculate the household food carbon footprint and measure the effect from shopping at the club stores on household carbon life. To address the self-selection concern into the club store shopping treatment, we implement a robust latent-factor approach, generalized synthetic control (GSC), to synthetically impute counterfactuals for treated units. Generalized synthetic control (GSC) unifies the synthetic control and interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. We find that the average treatment effect on the treated units is significantly positive: household per capita produces 6.65% more on food carbon emissions each quarter after starting to shop at the club stores. Next, we will investigate why shopping at the club stores increases the household food carbon footprint. If the specific characteristics of the club stores, like lower prices, larger package sizes, and different assortment, are main drivers for the club store carbon effect? Further, we will explore whether the club store carbon effect is heterogeneous across different households.
