3 - The Impact of Engagement with User-generated Content in Online Discussion Forums Varad Deolankar, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Ali Goli, S Sriram, Pradeep Chintagunta Many online platforms that offer firm-generated content (FGC) for consumption also provide the space for creation and consumption of user-generated content (UGC), usually in the form of discussion forums. We study whether a user’s engagement with UGC has an impact on their engagement with FGC. To this end, we use a novel dataset from Coursera, a popular online education platform, which has FGC in the form of lecture videos and supplementary readings and provides space for UGC consumption and creation via discussion threads about course materials. We use the exogenous variation in the forum home page as a shifter of a user’s propensity to engage with UGC (i.e., the discussion forum). This allows us to identify the causal effect of that user’s engagement with UGC on their engagement with FGC as well as their mastery of the content covered in that segment of the course. Our analysis suggests that, on average, a 10% increase in a student’s UGC engagement increases that student’s FGC engagement by 4.18% and performance by 0.34%. Therefore, our findings suggest that users tend to view UGC and FGC as complements. In the specific context of online education platforms, our results suggest that discussion forums can be used to bolster student engagement with course content as well as their learning.
