2 - Consumer Preferences for Sustainability Yewon Kim, Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, CA ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) - a concept that encloses a wide spectrum of values ranging from environmental sustainability to employee diversity - has become an important keyword for consumers, firms, and governments. Despite the large interests, little is known about consumer preferences for the ESG factors, such as which ESG message consumers prefer the most and whether those claims are substitutable with one another. This paper studies consumer preferences for and firmâ€™s practices of ESG values in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) market using information on product labels. The aim is 1) to help firms invest in ESG more effectively in a way that customers are actually responsive to, and 2) to help policy makers identify potential room for green- or ethics-washing by finding those claims without significant positive impact that consumers find particularly attractive.
