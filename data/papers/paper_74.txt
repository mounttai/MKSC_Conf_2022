3 - How Does Zestimate Affect Housing Market Outcomes Across Socio-economic Segments? Runshan Fu, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA Yan Huang, Nitin Mehta, Param Vir Singh, Kannan Srinivasan We study the impact of Zillow’s Zestimate on housing market outcomes and how the impact differs across socio-economic segments. Zestimate is produced by a machine learning algorithm using large amounts of data and aims to be an unbiased prediction of a home’s market value at any time. Zestimate can potentially help market participants in the housing market as identifying the value of a home is a non- trivial task. However, inaccurate Zestimate could also lead to incorrect belief about property values and hinder the selling process. Meanwhile, Zestimate tends to be significantly more accurate for rich neighborhoods than poor neighborhoods, raising concerns that the benefits of Zestimate accrue largely to the rich, widening socio-economic inequality. We build a structural model of a housing market where sellers and buyers face uncertainty about property values, and estimate the model on a unique dataset consisting of 3,724 properties listed in Pittsburgh between February and October 2019. The counterfactual analysis suggests that Zestimate benefits the housing market as on average it increases both buyer welfare and seller welfare. Moreover, Zestimate actually reduces socio-economic inequality, as our results reveal that both rich and poor neighborhoods benefit from Zestimate but the poor neighborhoods benefit more.
