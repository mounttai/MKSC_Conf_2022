2 - Sponsorships in Livestreaming: Monetization and Disclosure Behavior of Influencers on Twitch Ivan Li, Stanford GSB, Stanford, CA Monetization via product placement, sponsorships, or co- branding involves tradeoffs in the form of reduced product quality and/or diminished brand equity due to a sellout effect. Content creators, social media influencers, and even celebrities may obfuscate monetization attempts in order to circumvent brand equity costs. However, we know very little about the prevalence and effects of such attempts. I study such actions using a novel dataset of over 1000 of the most popular English-speaking influencers on Twitch.tv, the largest online video game livestreaming platform. My setting provides unique, quasi-random variation in the intensity of sponsorship disclosure; influencers can choose whether or not to lead their stream title with #ad or #sponsored, depending on how prominent they want to display sponsorships to potential viewers. I find that prominent disclosure is more common among influencers who rarely advertise, while frequently advertising influencers are more likely to obfuscate. I also find evidence for sellout effects of sponsored content decisions. Altogether, these descriptive facts support widespread anecdotes in the online livestreaming industry. I operationalize these findings using a dynamic framework involving advertising and disclosure decisions. My dynamic structural model allows me to quantify the long-run evolution of brand equity and its response to various counterfactual platform policies, such as mandatory full disclosure or levying commissions for external sponsorships.
