1 - Auctions of Auctions Robert Zeithammer, UCLA Anderson, Los Angeles, CA The real-time market for online advertising impressions is facilitated by several layers of intermediaries between the advertisers buying the impressions and the publishers selling them. For every potential advertising impression, online publishers run first-price header auctions to decide which advertising exchange gets to show an ad, and how much should the selected exchange pay. We analyzed a stylized model of two symmetric exchanges, each exclusively representing two advertisers. Each exchange holds and internal first-price auction to determine which of the advertisers it represents should advance to the header auction. Instead of passing the winning advertiser’s internal bid through passively, the exchange maximizes its own expected revenue by shading its winning advertiser’s bid when it bids on behalf of the advertiser in the header auction. In addition, the exchanges can set reserve prices to further increase their revenue. We characterize the optimal commission and reserve strategies of the exchanges.
