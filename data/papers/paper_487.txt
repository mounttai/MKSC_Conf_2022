4 - Success and Survival in Livestream Shopping Weiqing Zhang, New York University, New York, NY Zekun Liu, Xiao Liu, Eitan Muller, Feiyu Xiong The livestream shopping industry, in which consumers can purchase products directly from live video sessions, is expected to exceed $60 billion in China in 2021 and $25 billion in the US in 2023. Despite the popularity of livestream shopping, many sellers fail within just a few weeks. We investigate the lead indicators of the success and survival of livestream shopping sellers. We ask three questions: 1. Livestream viewers can make purchases directly within the session (the direct selling effect) or can use the session to gain information that may inform purchases later on (the advertising effect). Which of the two effects is more important for a sellerâ€™s success? 2. Livestream shopping encompasses three industries: e-commerce, social networks, and entertainment. Which industry-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) predict success? 3. Some sellers use livestream shopping for new product introduction while others use it for mature product inventory liquidation. Which type of seller is more likely to survive? We use a unique dataset from Taobao Live to show that: 1. Sellers who rely more heavily on the direct selling effect (vs. the advertising effect) are less likely to succeed. 2. The e-commerce KPI positively predict success, while the entertainment KPI negatively predicts success. For the social network KPIs, reach positively predict success, but engagement rate negatively predict success, reinforcing the advertising effect of livestream shopping. 3. Mature product sellers are more likely to succeed than new product sellers.
