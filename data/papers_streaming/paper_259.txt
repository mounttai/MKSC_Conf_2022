2 - Growing Sales with Influencers in Livestreaming Commerce Xian Gu, Indiana University, Bloominton, IN Xiaoxi Zhang, Pallassana K Kannan The rapid growth of high-speed mobile internet and technology has enabled live video streaming to become ubiquitous in recent years. As a result, livestreaming commerce, which combines live video streaming and e-commerce, has become quite popular. Despite its popularity, little is known about which factors contribute to the success of livestreaming commerce and how businesses should develop their product promotion strategies to maximize sales during a live event. In this research, we focus on the contribution of influencers (streamers) to sales  and the two major factors that businesses consider when choosing influencers to livestream their sales events: the popularity of influencers and the number of influencers. Marketers may choose to employ a single influencer with a large number of followers (a big influencer) to reach a large audience (a popularity-focused strategy) or they could reach an audience of similar size using multiple small influencers (a quantity-focused strategy). Using data from live events on the Chinese version of TikTok, we empirically quantify the effectiveness of both the popularity-focused and the quantity-focused influencer strategies on product sales. In particular, we find that a single big influencer can outperform ten small influencers promoting the same product. Moreover, we uncover an interesting negative interaction between the two strategies, implying that pursuing both popularity- focused and quantity-focused strategies at the same time may not always be ideal. Based on additional analyses, we highlight important differences between the popularity- focused and quantity-focused strategies across various livestreaming characteristics.
