2 - How Retailers Change Ordering Strategies when Suppliers Go Direct Femke Gryseels, KU Leuven, Antwerpen, Belgium Els Breugelmans, Kathleen Cleeren, Michiel Van Crombrugge This study empirically investigates whether a supplier’s decision to start selling directly to end-consumers provokes a reaction in terms of the ordering strategy of the downstream channel partners, i.e., the independent multi-brand retailers. We decompose (i) the aggregate metric of order value (in €) into changes in (ii) the number of distinct SKUs ordered, (iii) the quantity ordered per SKU, and (iv) the average wholesale price per unit. Next, we explore cross-retailer differences, investigating how responses vary depending on a retailer’s power position and its exchange relationship with the supplier. We use data from a natural experiment, where a toy supplier historically operated through independent retailers only, but then decided to supplement these with its own direct-to-consumer webshop in the UK and France only. Using a difference-in-differences model on B2B order data, we first investigate the impact of the direct channel entry in the two focal countries and compare it to a control country where the direct channel was not introduced during the observation window (Spain). To explore the cross-retailer variation,  we additionally collected survey data on the retailers’ relationship with the supplier before the channel introduction and investigate how the direct channel effect varies across retailers. Results show an overall decrease in the assortment and an increase in the wholesale price, suggesting that, on average, retailers are more likely to respond to the direct channel addition by exiting from the exchange. Furthermore, results on cross-retailer differences indicate that changes in retailer ordering strategy are moderated by both the retailer’s power position and exchange relationship.
