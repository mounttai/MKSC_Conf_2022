1 - Identifying Influential Users by Topic in User- Generated Image Content Mirai Igarashi, University of Tsukuba, Tokyo, Japan Kunpeng Zhang, Pallassana K Kannan, Nobuhiko Terui Social media users generate a variety of content which influence their followers’ behavior and preferences. In this study, we develop an approach to determine influential users who have significant impact on other users’ interest in the specific topics of user-generated image content. We propose a new variant of topic model with a hierarchical structure of vector auto-regressive model considering the evolution of topic distribution and the social influence among users on the levels of interest in content topics, extending the concepts of dynamic topic model and structural topi model. The methodology enables estimation of topic-specific influences from UGC data such that the social influence network varies across different topics. We not only identify the influential users for each topic of the content, but also illustrate the extent of the spillover of influence across topics. We apply the methodology to Pinterest data and show that the visualization of the estimated social influence on the network can provide insightful implications for social media marketing.
