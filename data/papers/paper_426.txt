1 - AI for Crowdsourcing? Integrated Theoretical Model for Idea Screening Christian Pescher, Universidad de los Andes, Santiago, Chile Jason Bell, Gerard J Tellis, Johann FÃ¼ller  Crowdsourcing generates thousands of ideas. While a boon to innovation, selection of best ideas is costly because of the limited number, expertise, objectivity, and attention of judges. This paper builds a theory-based model to automate idea screening. The authors explore predictors inspired bythree recently published models from the behavioral sciences: Word Colocation, Content Atypicality, and Inspiration Redundancy. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) versus Random Forest and RuleFit, the authors test performance of theory-based predictors in and out of sample. Data are from 21 different real-world crowdsourcing contestsconducted for large firms. Results are the following. First, the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) plots the false positive rate (x-axis) versus the true positive rate (y-axis) for values between 0 and 1; predictors inspired by each of the three original models contribute to in-sample and out-of-sample prediction, jointly providing the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of all models tested. Second, a new metric, Word Atypicality, predicts as well as this joint model but is more parsimonious and has higher screening efficiency. Third, method-wise, simple LASSO outperforms Random Forest and RuleFit. Fourth, the metrics are partial substitutes among the goodideas, but complementary at the bottom. Fifth, ROC curves show that this model with Word Atypicality can better screen out bad ideas than pick the single best idea, performing best when screening out as much as 44% of worst ideas for a false negative rate of only 15%. While the modelstill cannot pick the best idea, it provides an enormous gain in experts efficiency by eliminating almost half of bad ideas.
