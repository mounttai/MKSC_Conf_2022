10- How Does Bundling Affect Consumer Evaluation of Co-branded Services? Chia-Lin Lee, Taiwan Tech, Taipei, Taiwan One important parameter for defining various types of co- branded services involves the level of integration, that is, how closely two brands are linked in form and function. Previous studies have shown that when two brands are combined, their values influence each other only at a higher integration level. However, extant research in this field totally neglects whether consumers deem the offerings of brands to be a bundle—the bundling effect. The purpose of this paper is to bridge this critical gap. This study uses a mathematical model to illustrate our theory-driven proposition. Then, survey data are used to test the proposition empirically. The results show that, in the low-integrated co-branded services, the bundling  effect makes the partnering brands a composite offering in which the perceived performance of one brand can affect that of the other. Consequently, the values of both brands can be mutually affected. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to identify the bundling effect in co- branded services research.
