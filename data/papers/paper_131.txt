3 - The Causal Impact of Mall Entry on Incumbents: Substitution, Agglomeration and the Key Role of Mall Positioning Lu Feng, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China Keyan Zhu, Cheng He, Tong Wang, Yu Jeffrey Hu This paper studies the causal impact of mall entry on the incumbent malls. We conduct a quasi-experimental analysis by using a unique data set of traffic in 1,056 shopping malls. The results demonstrate that incumbents lose customer traffic by 3.4% after the entry on average. Heterogeneity analyses show that the incumbents that are closer to the entrants have fewer traffic losses. Specifically, the incumbents adjacent to the entrants have a traffic increase after the entry. The results also show that the entrants which are positioned as large- scale, low-priced, and newer brands cause more traffic losses to incumbents. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms driving mall customer traffic, namely agglomeration effect and substitution effect, as well as the role of mall positioning.
