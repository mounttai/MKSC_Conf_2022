3 - Creating More Successful Journeys by Managing Holidays And Abandonment Sharmistha Sikdar, Assistant Professor, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH Wayne Taylor, Scott Andrew Neslin, Wenyu Jiao In online retailing, a typical customer journey involves several customer actions, e.g., clicks on firm-served marketing communications, customer directed organic search, followed by more complex browsing behavior and finally a decision to buy. As a result, some of these journeys result in a sale, while others are abandoned along the way. We introduce a third possibility, that the customer does not abandon the journey but takes a break or holiday from search and buy activities with the firm and returns at a later point to resume the journey and potentially buy. We use clickstream data from a large travel site to model the path to purchase, accounting for holidays. The data include impressions (ads), engagement (clicks), and conversions (any customer-generated behavior, such as site visits and sales confirmations). Using this empirical setting and latent constructs, our goal is to predict the next customer action, i.e., a visit, a sale, or inactivity. Furthermore, conditional upon the inactivity, we infer whether the customer has entered a period of holiday or whether the customer has indeed abandoned the journey. Predicting a customer action such as sale, journey abandonment or customer churn, and holiday is important for managers to determine the next best possible action, e.g., whether to serve an ad to the customer. Furthermore, evaluating the attribution of the outcome (sale or journey abandonment) to the past set of touchpoints and platforms is crucial for managers to examine which touchpoints are most likely to lead to a success, i.e., a sale.
