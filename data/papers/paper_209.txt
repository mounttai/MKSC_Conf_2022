2 - Inference and Impact of Category Captaincy Xinrong Zhu, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI This paper studies category captaincy, a vertical relationship whereby the retailer delegates pricing and assortment decisions of an entire category to one of the leading manufacturers within the category. These contracts, which are confidential, can lead to disproportionately higher market shares for the captain’s products. The objective of this paper is to infer the existence of such contracts and to quantify their  impacts on prices, market shares, and profits of manufacturers and retailers. I use the yogurt category as an empirical setting, in which the captain is either Dannon or Yoplait- --the top two brands in the category by national market share. Using Nielsen scanner data, I first estimate a random- coefficient model of consumer demand. I use estimates of the brand-retailer specific shocks and a Bayesian inference model to classify retailers into one of the three categories: Dannon-captained retailers, Yoplait-captained retailers, or non-captained retailers. Conditional on the classified arrangements, I then apply conduct tests to infer that captains eliminate double markups from their own products, while the non-captain products still have double markups. The results from counterfactual experiments show that category captaincy arrangements increase market shares of the captain by about 50%, but they can also increase retailer profits and consumer welfare by eliminating double markups on the captain’s products.
