2 - Content Creation, Monetary Rewards, and Risk: How Creators Learn to be Creative Wensi Zhang, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA Sha Yang, Yanhao Wei What motivates content creators to explore a new content genre as opposed to exploiting familiar contents? This paper examines the effects of monetary rewards and risk and posits that a lower level of monetary rewards with less volatility encourages exploration by reducing the opportunity costs of tapping into a new genre. Using a novel data source from a live streaming platform, we find that the decrease in platform- level monetary reward and reward volatility during the COVID-19 lockdown indeed promotes creators’ willingness to explore. To gain more insights into the mechanism, we build and estimate a structural model where creators face uncertainty in their monetary reward from producing each content genre and update their belief through their past creation and consumption experience. As such, our model allows us to study how platform policies affect creators’ content choice and their tendency to explore new content.
