1 - Influence Corridors: A New Path to Seeding Targets on User-Generated Content Platforms Andreas Lanz, HEC Paris, Paris, France , Jacob Goldenberg, Daniel Shapira, Florian Stahl On user-generated content platforms, individuals and firms alike seek to build and expand their follower base to increase the reach of the content they upload. This setting generally belongs to influencer marketing, where the bulk of the seeding literature suggests targeting users with a large following—the high-status influencers. In contrast, some recent studies find targeting low-status influencers to be a more effective seeding policy to build a follower base due to their higher responsiveness. We revisit these two opposing policies and investigate how social capital—the value embedded in the expanding follower base—can directly support seeding efforts. Based on the rationale that the follower base serves as an intermediary of group identity, we demonstrate in data-based simulations that using the first-degree followers as influence corridors to target the low-status second-degree followers—i.e., the connected low-status influencers—is much more effective than targeting (1) unconnected high-status influencers and (2) unconnected low-status influencers. We augment the empirical study on this friends of friends phenomenon with a pre- registered field experiment and thereby obtain convergent validity of our findings.
