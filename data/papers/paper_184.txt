1 - Consequences of Taxing the Online Advertising Industry Lennart Kraft, Goethe University, Frankfurt, German Regulations such as privacy laws increasing consumer privacy have pressured targeted advertising. Recently, regulators worldwide have been intensifying taxation of the online advertising industry, further increasing this pressure. However, the consequences of such taxes remain largely unknown. This study aims to provide insights into these consequences by examining how different data taxes impact publisher and advertiser profits of targeting, regulator’s tax revenue, deadweight loss, and consumer privacy. The empirical study builds upon 999 ad campaigns covering 6,761,507 ad impressions and finds that an advertiser-paid data tax outperforms a publisher-paid data tax in five out of six relevant trade-offs. More specifically, it creates higher tax revenue and higher or equal consumer privacy for the same decrease in publisher and advertiser profits and the same deadweight loss. Yet, recent intensifications of taxing the online advertising industry build mainly upon taxes resembling publisher-paid data taxes. Hence, the study suggests that regulators could improve the taxes’ impact if they implement advertiser-paid data taxes instead. For example, a publisher-paid data tax of 3% on targeted advertising revenue yields a 2.5 times higher deadweight loss than an advertiser-paid data tax. The study concludes with implications of data taxes for publishers, advertisers, consumers, and regulators.
