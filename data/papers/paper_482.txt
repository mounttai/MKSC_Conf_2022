2 - Exclusive Strategy in Content Platforms: The Role of Consumer Preference Distribution Tengfei Guo, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China Peng Wang Exclusive contracts are widely introduced by content platforms to prohibit their content providers from dealing with other rivals. We develop a game-theoretical model to examine both the determinants and the consequences of exclusive vs. non-exclusive contracts in platform competition. While existing literature on platform competition typically assumes uniform consumer preference distribution, our analysis highlights the significance of consumer preference distributional forms. By relaxing the uniformity assumption, we obtain several important findings. First, we show that whether exclusive or non-exclusive equilibrium occurs depends critically on the shape of consumer preference distribution: When consumer preference distribution is sufficiently concentrated, exclusivity always arises as the equilibrium outcome; while when the distribution is sufficiently polarized, the content provider always serve both platforms in the equilibrium. More interestingly, when the dispersion level of consumer preference distribution is intermediate, both exclusivity and non-exclusivity equilibria are possible depending on the value of the focal content. Second, regarding the value of potentially exclusive content, we show that under either exclusive or non-exclusive equilibrium, platforms cannot benefit from the high valuation of the content. Third, we show that exclusivity may hurt both platforms, even for the one who wins the exclusive content. Finally, we identify the conditions when the mere existence of exclusive contracts increases the user benefits, suggesting that banning exclusive contracts may not always lead to the most desirable outcome. Our findings enrich the understanding of platform competition and provide practical insights for both platform owners and policymakers.
