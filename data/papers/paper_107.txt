2 - Inattention Skimming: Theory and Evidence from Resale Markets Andreas Kraft, PhD Candidate, University of Texas - Austin, Austin, TX Raghunath S Rao Evidence of consumer inattention has been found in various settings, both inside and outside the laboratory. It is, however, less clear how inattention affects market outcomes. Can firms profit from consumer inattention? If so, by how much? Does competition alleviate and save inattentive consumers? We answer those questions in the context of secondary markets. We find that intermediaries and the product owners in these  markets benefit when buyers are inattentive to an important product attribute. Our model shows that the competition between intermediaries and decentralized consumer-to- consumer markets results in a behavioral segmentation of the market. The intermediary skims inattentive consumers while attentive consumers are served in the consumer-to-consumer market. We test our theory using a detailed dataset consisting of millions of automobile transactions over seven years. First, we find clear evidence of a specific type of inattention: Buyers exhibit left-digit bias and systematically underestimate the depreciation of vehicles with odometer readings immediately below round cutoffs (e.g., 49,950mi vs. 50,000 mi). Second, the level of estimated inattention in dealer transactions is twice as high as in private transactions, resulting in dealers making a significantly higher margin for such vehicles. Third, we estimate the supply-side response to consumer inattention and find that there are 2.19% fewer transactions in the full attention counterfactual. As a result, the average profit margin is 2.36% lower, leading to an aggregate decrease in profits of 4.94% or about $500 million within our sample period. Back-of-the-envelope calculations imply that U.S. used vehicle dealersâ€™ annual profits attributable to consumer inattention to depreciation are about $800 million.
