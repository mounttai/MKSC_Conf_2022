1 - Statistical Inference for the Factor Model Approach to Estimate Causal Effects in Quasi- experimental Settings Kathleen Li, University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business, Austin, TX Garrett Sonnier Causal inference using quasi-experimental data is of great interest to marketers. The factor model approach (FM) to estimate treatment effects accommodates a large number of control units and can easily handle a large number of treatment units while flexibly allowing for cases where the treatment is outside the range of the control units. However, the factor model method lacks formal inference theory, instead relying on bootstrap or permutation procedures with strong assumptions. Specifically, the extant Xu (2017) bootstrap procedure requires that the treatment and control error variance are equal. We establish that when this assumption is violated, the bootstrap procedure results in biased coverage intervals. We develop formal inference theory for the factor model approach to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Our approach allows researchers to formally quantify uncertainty through hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Our inference method is applicable to both stationary and non-stationary data. More importantly, our inference theory  accommodates treatment and control unit outcomes with different distributions, which includes different error variances as a special case. We show the performance of our inference theory in simulated data. Finally, we apply our method to empirically quantify the uncertainty in the effect of legalizing recreational marijuana on the beer market and the sales effect of a digitally native online brand opening a physical showroom.
