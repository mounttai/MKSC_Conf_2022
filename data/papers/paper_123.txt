3 - Improving Churn Detection by Tackling Redundancy in Big Data Christian Colot, PostDoctoral Researcher, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg Zoran Obradovic The explosion of digital data has led to very promising opportunities to leverage it for decision-making. However, a key challenge is to deal with the redundancy issue that might arise among extracted features. This redundancy might indeed lead to select a sub optimal model and also to slow down the convergence of the algorithm. In the present empirical study, we compare the performance of a recent variation of Random Forest namely Essence Random Forest to Gradient Boosting for churn prediction within a telephone company. In particular, this case study includes multiple extracted features from unstructured data with a high level of redundancy. Our results highlight that, without any time constraint, Gradient Boosting reaches a higher classification performance. However, Essence Random converges approximately four times faster than Gradient Boosting to its best performance. Notably, the latter method overtakes the former after 2.7 times the time needed for Essence Random Forest to offer its best result. Overall, these results indicate that the choice of the algorithm depends on the importance of time in the context. What is more, a hybrid combination of both algorithms might be considered as future work as the key mechanism behind Essence Random Forest i.e. a weighted random sampling of features according to redundancy might be implemented in Gradient Boosting. This hybrid combination might potentially speed up the convergence of Gradient Boosting.
