2 - Brand or Category Competition - The Effect of a Choice Set on Donation Decisions Gil Peleg, Yeshiva University, NYC, NY Oded Lowengart, Gal Gutman, Merav Weiss-Sidi Charities, pro-social organizations, and social initiatives compete for private donations when they fundraise via gala events, social networks, fundraising websites, and other channels. The vast number of people and organizations soliciting donors for their money is enormous, making donorsâ€™ decisions highly complex. Potential donors pick up ques from rival organizations and incorporate these ques into their decision process to simplify the donation decision process. This research identifies these ques and examines how potential donors incorporate them into their decision process in a brand-level and category-level competition. Across four online studies, we show that although the ques are similar in both levels of competition, the importance that donors assign to them differs when facing different choice sets. While, for organizations that fight for various causes (i.e., fighting cancer or fighting heart disease), the cause is what matters, other characteristics become more critical for organizations that fight for the same cause (i.e. fighting poverty). Our findings expand the understanding of donation decisions and contribute to practitioners by suggesting differential communication approaches aligned with the level of competition.
