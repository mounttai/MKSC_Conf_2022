1 - Competitive Disclosure of Multiple Product Attributes James Dearden, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA Qichao Shi, Ernest Lai, David Goldbaum Firms engaging in competition are motivated to make known to consumers the superiority of their products relative to their competitors’. When products have multiple attributes, this incentive manifests as a tendency to underscore the product attributes that represent one’s strength and to downplay the attributes that are not as exceptional. In a familiar term, comparative advantages of some sorts are at work to influence what firms disclose and not disclose to consumers. This paper analyzes how this and other factors contribute to determine quality disclosure in a competitive setting with multiple product attributes. We analyze a duopolistic model of quality disclosure in which product differentiation can be either horizontal or vertical under two vertically differentiated product attributes. Disclosure is fully revealing in the absence  of disclosure cost. When disclosure is costly, firms partially disclose, and the characterization of the non-disclosure sets of the firms are shaped by three familiar economic properties, namely, product differentiation, comparative advantages, and intensity of price competition. When consumers fall short of forming rational expectation after non-disclosure, firms may partially disclose even without disclosure cost, and the three properties continue to dictate firms’ disclosure behavior in the boundedly rational paradigm.
