2 - Humanoid Service Robots (HSRs) in Supporting Physician-patient Interactions: The Avatar May Need No Introduction! Hari Ravella, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA  Dipankar Chakravarti Whereas HSRs offer potential for supporting physician- patient interactions, recent research shows that patients may show low receptivity to HSRs due to concerns such as uniqueness neglect. Moreover, receptivity may be lower if the HSR is seen as replacing or leading the human physician vs. playing a supporting role.Our research (set in a breast cancer consultation context) examines how communication style (CS: empathetic/impassive manipulated via facial expression and voice tone) drives patient responses to the physician’s avatar (HSR) vs. the physician in-person. We also manipulate physician type (human/ similar avatar/ dissimilar avatar) and the patient mindset (hope/fear) about a breast cancer diagnosis. Relevant samples of adult females (from a web panel) evaluated videos of the purported interactions. In Study 1, the interaction included a preamble where the human physician introduced the avatar as an assistant, indicating that the diagnosis/treatment information would be provided on the next visit by the either the physician himself or the avatar (similar/ dissimilar). Participants then rated the interaction. Whereas mindset had no main effects on persuasion, trust, and liking, the empathetic (versus impassive) CS produced higher scores on each measure (all p’s< .0001). Notably, the human physician scored higher than either avatar (all p’s<.0001).Study 2 used an identical three-factor design. However, there was no preamble, and the human physician did not introduce the avatar. In this setting, both avatars scored higher than the human physician on persuasion, trust, and liking (ps <.0001). Our results suggest that patients may be receptive to avatar interactions when they are not introduced as assistants. Receptivity should improve as HSRs become common.
