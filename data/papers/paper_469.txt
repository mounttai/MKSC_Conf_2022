4 - Hospital Reviews, Clinical Quality of Care, and Providers’ Response Nah Lee, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, Durham, NC Richard Staelin  Despite the surging increase in the public awareness and usage of online patient reviews for healthcare services, little is known about how these reviews affect healthcare provider’s behavior. To this goal, we study the clinical performance of 2,773 U.S. hospitals in recent years when reviews are widely available and examine how it has changed compared to the performance in the pre-review era. To this end we analyzed over 300k Google reviews. Our overarching premise is that multiple measures of patient reviews, including the content focus of the reviews (i.e., clinical or non-clinical), and the valence and variance of the content, may influence hospital manager’s decision on the quality of care provided. Of particular interest is the heterogeneity of hospital responses across covariates such as the hospital’s characteristics, patient socio-demographic variables, and the degree of competition facing the hospital. Using an exploratory data analysis approach and a diff-in-diff design and causal forests, we identify a number of variables that influence the impact of review variables on hospital’s performance including the helpfulness of the reviews, competitive intensity, hospital size, and education level and age of the population the hospital serves. Interestingly, provider type, ownership structure, and whether or not the hospitals write response comments to the online reviews did not materially influence the association between review variables and changes in hospital performance. We offer insights on how the impact of the review variables is affected by meaningful covariates.
