1 - Category Learning through Experiential Product Images Liu Liu, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO Natasha Foutz, Masakazu Ishihara Consumers face great uncertainly of product content and quality before purchasing experiential products. We hence quantify the impact of product images on sales and post- purchase satisfaction. Specifically, we focus on product images used in advertising and packaging to address the following key questions. (1) Do these images provide typical content information about product contents and categories? And (2) How does the extent of typicality impact sales and post-purchase satisfaction? We empirically examine these questions using a canonical example of experiential products - motion pictures. Analyzing 10,000+ moviesâ€™ poster images via deep learning image classification models, we link two constructed metrics, product typicality and ambiguity, to box office. We further discuss the substantive and strategic implications of our findings.
