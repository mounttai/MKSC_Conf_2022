1 - Incorporating Co-locations into Deep Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning for POI Prediction Hanyu Zhang, Emory University, Atlanta, GA Kunpeng Zhang, David A Schweidel Mobile location data has been used to deliver targeted advertising and predict future behavior. Yet, most marketing research leveraging such data focuses on the behavior of individual consumers. In this research, we empirically assess the value of incorporating co-location networks into a predictive model of future point-of-interest (POI) visits. To do so, we first formulate a heterogeneous information network capturing semantic relations among different types of entities  (e.g., users and POIs). We then implement a deep network representation learning method to investigate the latent and complex relations among users and POIs. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the addition of the co-location network improves predictive performance by 108.75% compared to baseline models that ignore such data. Our findings demonstrate the potential use for mobile location data to construct such networks to support marketing efforts.
