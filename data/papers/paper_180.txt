1 - Closing the TV Advertising Loop with Web Browsing Data Leen De Schaepdrijver, Vlerick Business School, Ghent, Belgium , Philippe Baecke, Koen Tackx Lagging behind in measurement capabilities, TV is pushing data-focused marketers away and into the arms of digital advertising giants such as Facebook and Google, that are often being favored due to direct accountability in terms of cost per click. This paper investigates whether web browsing data can be used to close the TV advertising loop, by linking household TV ad exposure to individual online response. Our study allows to move from an aggregated approach per (pre/post) time window, as is the current practice in literature, to an individual link between TV ad exposure and online response. We created a unique dataset by merging 3 months of household level TV viewing data from 1885 customers of a European telecommunications company with measures on advertisement content and web browsing data on an individual level. The dataset spans over 300 TV commercials by 118 brands. By using a matching approach, we are able to compare the browsing behavior of people that were exposed to an advertisement to that of people who were not. We use a generalized linear mixed model to investigate TV advertising effectiveness. The initial findings indicate that television advertising does influence online visits and that this effect diminishes over time. Moreover, TV advertising seems to have a stronger effect on web visits during daytime, while advertising during the weekend has a negative effect. TV advertising content seems to play an important role,  with action-focused content having a positive effect on web visits and information-focused content having a negative effect. The preliminary results suggest that advertising copy and media placement characteristics such as time of advertising affect online response, making them especially relevant for campaigns that focus on the consideration and conversion stage.
