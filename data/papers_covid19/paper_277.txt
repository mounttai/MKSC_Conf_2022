1 - The Shift in Consumers’ Brand Preference of Grocery Products from Major Brands to Private Labels: Evidence from a Dutch Retailer Hao Chen, NielsenIQ, Chicago, IL Alvin Lim  This research investigates the change in consumers’ brand preference of essential grocery products before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in brand diversity in categories such as personal hygiene and cleaning products lead us to hypothesize a shift in consumers’ brand preference from major national brands to private label and lesser-known brands. We conduct empirical data analyses of customer transactions from a Dutch grocery chain using a discrete choice model. Insights from the analyses, such as decrease in utility of major brands in certain categories, provide valuable theoretical and managerial implications for retail business practitioners, particularly in inventory planning and pricing strategy of national brand and private label products.
