1 - Demand Estimation with Pairwise Variables Stephan Seiler, Imperial College Business School, London, United Kingdom Giovanni Compiani, Ilya Morozov We propose a model of demand that allows utility to be correlated as a function product-pair level variables, such as how similar product labels are or how similar customer reviews are between different products. To incorporate these variables into a discrete choice demand framework, we estimate a paired combinatorial logit model where  each product is in a separate nest with every other product and allow the nesting parameters to depend on pairwise variables. Our framework is computationally light and does not require simulation, implying that it can be applied to online settings where assortments are often large and rich information on product similarity can be gleaned from various sources. We apply the model to data from an online wine merchant, estimate demand for 50 products and show that pair-specific variables are helpful to estimate a flexible cross- price elasticity matrix.
