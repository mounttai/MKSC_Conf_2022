1 - Social Pricing Across Products and Consumers: Randomized Field Experiments on a Comprehensive Online Retailer Haibing Gao, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China Online retailers are meshing their pricing strategies with consumers’ social networks, aiming to reach the pattern of social pricing: i.e., consumers with higher social network value enjoy better (cheaper) prices. For example, many online retailers allow consumers to invite peers from social networks to request a discount for their purchases. Under social pricing, online retailers may benefit from more sales and profit  because it encourages more proactive social interactions among consumers and thus produces larger social influence on peers’ purchases. By collaborating with a comprehensive online retailer in China, this study conducts several randomized field experiments to investigate the effectiveness of social pricing across products and consumers. The first experiment shows that usefulness of social pricing varies with product and consumer characteristics. We find that social pricing is more effective in promoting new products than existing products. Exploration of the underlying mechanism shows that new products can more readily attract consumer attention and thus encourage information sharing among social networks. Moreover, social pricing is more effective in enhancing sales and profit among experience products than search products. The underlying cause is that consumers have greater desire to share purchases of experience products (vs. search products). The second experiment shows that social pricing is more effective among variety seeking consumers of different brands than loyal consumers of the same brand, if the retailer’s goal is to stimulate cross buying of different brands. However, social pricing is more useful among loyal consumers (than variety seeking consumers), if the retailer’s purpose is to promote repeat purchases of the same brand.
