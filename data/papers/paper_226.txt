3 - Discrete Choice in Marketing Through the Lens of Rational Inattention Sergey Turlo, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany Matteo Fina, Johannes Kasinger, Arash Laghaie, Thomas Otter Models derived from random utility theory represent the work-horse methods to learn about consumer preferences from discrete choice data collected in experimental and observational settings. % in economics and marketing. However, a large body of literature documents a variety of behavioral patterns that cannot be captured by basic random utility models and that require different non-unified adjustments to accommodate these patterns.In this review article, we illustrate how a discrete choice model rooted in rational inattention (RI) theory nests a significant set of these patterns.We present illustrative simulations, discuss extant empirical work using experiments and observational data, and suggest how to develop an RI model for the analysis of discrete choice among multiple alternatives described along multiple attributes as encountered in prototypical discrete choice experiments and choice-based-conjoint analysis in marketing and economics.
