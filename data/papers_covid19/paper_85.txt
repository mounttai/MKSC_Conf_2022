3 - Brand Equity and Channel Effects Anthony Koschmann, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, MI Kevin Lane Keller Understanding brands and brand equity is a top priority for academics and practitioners alike. Marketers want to know how strong their brands are, and factors that enhance or detract from that strength. Towards that goal, academics have developed conceptual models and frameworks of brand equity (e.g., Aaker 1992; Keller 1993) while industry  practitioners have developed models of brand valuation (e.g., Interbrand; Millward-Brown). One particularly insightful approach has looked at the strength of brands from the perspective of revenue premiums (ALN: Ailawadi, Lehmann, and Neslin 2003). Indeed, ALNâ€™s focus of comparing brand revenues to those of private labels has produced much investigation into private label research and its impact on brands. However, while brand health is important for managers, an overlooked aspect is the role channels have in generating brand equity. This study investigates drivers of brand equity across four channels using nine years of consumer packaged good data in 882 categories. The authors find that asymmetrical effects occur not just across channels, but for brand leadership as well in being able to drive brand equity.
