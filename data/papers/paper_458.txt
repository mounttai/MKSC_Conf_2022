1 - Strategic Media Planning for New Products: Channel Substitution and Synergy Vahideh Sadat Abedi, California State University Fullerton, Orange, CA Oded Berman, Fred M Feinberg, Dmitry Krass New product and service introductions require careful joint planning of production and marketing campaigns. Consequently, they typically utilize multiple information channels to stimulate customer awareness and resultant word-of-mouth (WOM), availing of standard budget allocation tools. By contrast, when enacting strategic allocation decisions - which must align with other management imperatives - dividing expenditures across channels is far more complex. To this end, we formulate a multi-channel demand model for new products (or services), amenable to analysis of inter- and intra-channel interaction patterns and with the word-of-mouth process, without building such interactions directly into the modeling framework. We propose a novel decomposition of the multi-channel dynamic programming problem into two distinct tiers: the strategic  tier addresses how to allocate total expenditure across channels, while the tactical tier studies how to allocate the channel-specific budgets (determined in the strategic tier) over time periods. This decomposition enables optimal media strategies to sidestep the curse of dimensionality and renders the model pragmatically estimable. The model provides actionable managerial insights into when, and which, channel interactions are synergistic vs. substitutive. Specifically, a channelâ€™s interactions are governed primarily by its own leverage (potential demand impact) and the WOM-based demand momentum (market penetration) it can generate, affording a novel basis for channel typography and firm action. The modeling framework is illustrated by examining camera sales for two media channels (FSIs and radio) and their effects over 28 months.
