3 - Life Transitions Enhance Receptivity to Sustainability Behaviors Yandou Lu, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA , Dipankar Chakravarti Although appeals for environment-friendly and sustainable consumption behaviors rarely meet overt opposition, motivating consumers to adopt and maintain sustainability behaviors is an ongoing challenge. Our research aims to identify triggering cues that create consumer mindsets that are attuned to being more receptive to implementing (and maintaining) sustainability behaviors.Life transitions, whether temporal (e.g., a birthday or a new year), locational (e.g., a new home or a new office), personal (e.g., marriage, family additions), or professional (e.g., graduation, or a new job) involve discontinuities that create opportunities to revisit prior habits and behaviors and adopting new ones (Verplanken & Roy 2016). Whether positive or negative, such transitions create life-script changes that may place individuals in a fresh-start mindset (Price et al. 2018) where they may be more receptive to new goals and lifestyles that are consistent with self-transformation.We propose and empirically test the idea that consumers may be more receptive to propositions advocating the adoption of new sustainability behaviors (e.g., recycling, energy conservation, food habits) in the presence (versus absence) of a salient transition cue (temporal, locational, etc.). This facilitates the adoption of the advocated behavior even in the face of serious incremental cost and/or effort penalties. We further argue that such adoption is mediated by a self-generated fresh-start mindset that is triggered by the transition. We also propose and show that if the behavior is promoted and as a default option (Jachimowicz et al, 2019), the behavior change may be more enduring. Our findings have significant implications for policymakers interested in instilling pro- sustainability consumer behaviors.
