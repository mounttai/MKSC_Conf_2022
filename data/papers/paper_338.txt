2 - Digital Content Exploration: The Tradeoff Between Self-navigation and Limited Recommendations Qi Xie, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN Linli Xu, George John The dramatic growth of digital content platforms has significantly expanded consumers’ content access but also led to an information overload problem. Hence, the recommendation system has been widely used by digital content platforms to facilitate consumers’ content exploration process. In general, most recommendation systems could be classified into two types: a self-navigation recommender and a single-item embedded recommender. The former generates a large number of alternatives for consumers to choose from, whereas the latter is only recommending a single item embedded in a clicked content. Using data from a short-video platform that employs both recommendation systems, we explore how the interaction of these two systems influences users’ digital content consumption. Our model-free evidence suggests a non-sequential responding path under the self-navigation mode and a synergy between the two recommendation systems. We then build an empirical model encompassing a sequence of micro decisions to describe consumers’ searching and viewing actions. The results further indicate the duration and the number of videos a user has browsed the front page as well as the content variety, quality and position can affect both the flow of users’ exploration  process and their viewing choices. We also find that a higher level of content variety from previously viewed videos could help drive more subsequent consumptions.
