1 - The Welfare Effects of Vertically Integrated Platforms: Evidence from E-Commerce Platforms Andrey Fradkin, Boston University, Boston, MA Chiara Farronato Platforms that help match many fragmented buyers and sellers of goods and services sometimes vertically integrate, by directly selling their own products. Take Amazon, one of the most important companies in the world as measured by the amount of economic activity passing through its market ($475B), its valuation ($1.74T), and its number of employees (1.5M). Amazon owns a variety of private labels, including  Amazon Basics, Pinzon, and GoodThreads, which directly compete with independent sellers. We propose a new field experimental methodology for measuring the welfare benefits and costs of this form of vertical integration in e-commerce.
