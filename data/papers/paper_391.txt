These temporary, strategically planned physical retail spaces serve as an important mix of omnichannel marketing strategy and have shown their success with delivering personalized brand experiences, expanding current markets, and building up connections in marketing practices. This paper empirically examines the causal impact of pop-up stores on the traffic and sales at mall and store levels by leveraging a unique data set from 100 shopping malls in  China. The temporal and spatial substitutional effects, as well as heterogeneous effects regarding types, timing, and locations of pop-up stores, are also discussed.
