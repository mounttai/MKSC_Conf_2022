1 - Incentivized Reviews Sungsik Park, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC Woochoel Shin, Jinhong Xie Firms often provide financial incentives to motivate consumers to post reviews of their products. Despite the popularity of so-called incentivized reviews (IRs), little is known about the consequences of this practice. This paper investigates IRs from the perspectives of important market stakeholders: firms, consumers, and policy makers (or platforms). First, using an Amazon policy change from condoning to prohibiting IRs as our empirical context, we find a positive sales effect of IRs, which suggests that IRs are an effective marketing investment for firms. Second, our analysis reveals that (a) IRs have inflated ratings and richer content relative to organic reviews and (b) removing IRs is associated with higher post-purchase product evaluations by consumers, suggesting that IRs increase the risk that consumers will make a suboptimal decision. We also find that IRs are more likely to be posted to mid-quality than high- or low-quality products, suggesting that consumers should be particularly cautious when buying mid-quality products to protect themselves from being misled by IRs. Finally, based on incentive compatibility, we develop conjectures regarding how a platform-initiated IR system could be more socially desirable (e.g., with uninflated rating) than a firm-initiated one. We empirically validate these conjectures using Amazonâ€™s Vine program. We discuss implications of these findings for firms, platforms, and policymakers.
