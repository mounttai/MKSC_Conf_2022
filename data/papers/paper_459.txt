2 - Shipping Subscriptions in B2B: Multichannel Demand Implications Baris Kocaman, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands Sarah Gelper, Fred Langerak, Tom Van Woensel Following the recent uptake of subscription-based shipping services in B2C online channels, omnichannel sellers in business markets are increasingly offering shipping subscription programs to survive in the competitive digital landscape. However, B2B channel management is typically more complex than B2C owing to the salesperson channel, which leaves businesses unsure about the effectiveness of such programs and how they fit with their omnichannel ambitions. We address this problem by studying the multichannel demand implications (purchase value, frequency, variety, and basket size) of a shipping subscription program in a B2B setting. Using data from a global B2B high-tech tools manufacturer and a synthetic control approach, we demonstrate strong differences in the effect of the subscription program across channels. While subscribing to free shipping does not increase purchase value, it increases purchase frequency, variety, and the share of purchases in the salesperson channel. In the online channel, we do not observe significant changes except a smaller basket size. In the store channel, we do not observe any significant changes. The studyâ€™s results offer guidance for omnichannel sellers on managing subscription programs in B2B multichannel environments. Specifically, since the salesperson channel is also the costliest, it is recommended that sellers manage salesperson response proactively.
