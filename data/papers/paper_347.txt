4 - Sending the Wrong Message: Understanding Influencers Role in the Spread of Disinformation Roman Welden, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN Leah Smith, Michael Haenlein, Kelly Hewett While influencer marketing provides many positives for society, its popularity has also given rise to the spread of disinformation. The growing role of influencers has led to an evolution of disinformation in terms of both reach and complexity. Nearly 40% of all social media users regularly share disinformation, triggering a need to understand how disinformation messages are structured and spread. Using affect as information theory, the authors propose that the structures surrounding an influencers social network (e.g., micro vs macro influencer, connections with other influencers) interacts with message elements (emotional valence, cognitive activation, and credibility) to impact the ways in which individuals react to disinformation messages. Using a proposed multi-method approach (including sentiment analysis of Twitter posts containing disinformation, social network analysis of influencers known to spread disinformation, biometric analysis of individuals exposed to disinformation, and lab/field experiments) the authors hope to show how these messages spread and the steps marketers, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders can take to combat disinformation.
