1 - Telling a Coherent Story: The Importance of Image-text Coherence in Digital Advertising Jochen Hartmann, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Display advertising often includes an image and a textual tagline that individually and jointly are aimed at conveying information and enticing consumers to buy. In this research, we explore how each one of these communication modes affect consumers’ reaction to the ad. Specifically, we explore how the image-text coherence drives ad effectiveness. To operationalize coherence, we formulate an iterative masked language modeling problem to assess the fit of the concepts in the image in the context of the text. This measure exploits the sequential nature of human language as well as the contextual meaning of words. We explore our novel measure in conjunction with alternative embedding-based image-text similarity measures to study the multi-faceted interaction between ads and taglines.We collaborate with a display ad platform, leveraging a large-scale multi-modal dataset, including tens of thousands of cross-category digital ads and consumers’ reactions to these ads in terms of click- through rates (CTRs), one of online marketing’s core outcome variables. A unique aspect of our dataset is that it often provides a quasi-experimental setting to study text-image coherence with the same image appearing with different taglines and the same tagline appearing with multiple ads. Controlling for a host of visual and textual characteristics of the ads (e.g., complexity, abstraction, emotion), we find an inverted-U relationship between coherence and CTR. Our results suggest that advertisers and scholars are well-advised to assess images and texts together rather than individually. Methodologically, we build on the language modelling literature to develop a novel measure of image-text coherence, which captures a unique image-text relationship, above and beyond their mere similarity.
