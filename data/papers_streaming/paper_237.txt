4 - Can Vegan Product Distribution Mitigate Food Deserts Disparities? A Natural Experiment from Burger King Erya Ouyang, Temple Univeristy, Philadelphia, PA Yang Wang, Xueming Luo Using a large foot traffic dataset from SafeGraph, we construct a natural experiment to study the demand effects of Burger King’s plant-based protein product - Impossible Whopper- launch in the food deserts.We observe Point- of-Interest (POI) level daily visits before and immediately following the Burger King’sIntroduction of Impossible Whopper. Our results show an increased foot traffic to Burger King relative to that of nearby gas station locations. By decomposing the visits by food deserts and socioeconomic variables, we find that the growth in visits to Burger King is mainly derived from non-food deserts locations and driven by people who live in neighborhoods with higher white population and higher education level. Additionally, we observe a distribution effect of increased visits from Food Deserts to Burger King locations in non-food deserts. Furthermore, we show that increased demand effect of Impossible Whopper is spilled over to grocery stores that carry plant-based product. Collectively our results highlight the effectiveness of Impossible Whopper’s introduction at mitigating partial food disparity issue in the food deserts.
