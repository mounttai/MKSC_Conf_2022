3 - Brand Activism on Social Media and Consumer Responses Seoyoung Kim, Doctoral Candidate, University of Georgia, Athens, GA Sundar G Bharadwaj Notwithstanding the inherent risk of speaking out about social controversies, brands are feeling the pressure to participate in the wave of activism and take a stand on various social problems. Faced with the dilemma of escalating calls for activism and the inevitable riskiness of activist actions, brands are still left uncertain about whether and how they can advantageously incorporate activism in their marketing communication on social media. Against this backdrop, this study investigates conditions under which a brand’s activist action can generate favorable consumer responses. Analyzing a rich multi-source daily panel dataset composed of brands’ activist actions on social media (i.e., Instagram) and extensive panel survey on brand perception with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and causal inference techniques, this study suggests that a brand’s activist action that is comprehensible, truthful, sincere, and legitimate can engender favorable consumer responses towards the brand. Overall, this study is expected to contribute to theory and practice by shedding light on how brands can overcome the risk of being an activist and how brands should implement brand activism.
