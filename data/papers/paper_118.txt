3 - Disentangling Monetary and Social Effects of Sales Contest Leaderboards Yuanchen Su, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN George John, Madhu Viswanathan Sales contests, which use relative performance to evaluate and reward employees, have long been considered a viable short-term tool for improving efforts. Often, these contests  are multi-period with interim results available. One issue unsettled is whether interim results should be published as public leaderboards. Leaderboards influence monetary motivation - interim standings allow contestants to better calibrate their effort given their distance from the prize(s). They also influence social motivation - the first page of the leaderboard brings social recognition whilst being on the last page is disheartening. Using data of five 8-week long contests with leaderboards updating twice a week, we find next-day sales after each leaderboard update displays a U-shape. Specifically, salespeople on the first page or the last page make more sales than people who are on the intermediate pages. This offers identification of social motivation since a purely rational model predicts people who are on the last page would make fewer following-day sales than people on the penultimate page since people on the last page have less chance to catch up and win the prize(s). Regressions reinforce this takeaway. People who are close to the boundaries of the first and last pages make more next-day sales than their neighbors. These neighbors are farther away from the boundary but assumed to have similar monetary motivation with people close to the boundaries since they have similar cumulative sales. We build a structural model to estimate a) monetary motivation sensitivity, b) social motivation sensitivity, and c) cost of effort. These deep parameters help disclose the mechanisms at hand.
