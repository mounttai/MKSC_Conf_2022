2 - Managers’ Salaries Effect on Customer Behavior Oded Lowengart, Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel Gil Peleg In the last decade, customers worldwide have expressed dissatisfaction with business activities’ unfairness, especially from unequal wage distribution among employees (i.e., high CEO-to-regular workers’ wage ratio). Research on the potential effect of such wages on customers’ behavior indicates that presenting unequal wage distribution to customers at the time of purchase might hurt their tendency to purchase products and satisfaction. We propose that unfair wage distribution is salient in customers’ decisions and manifested as a product/ service attribute through price fairness’ perceptions. We decompose the wage distribution inequality by separating perceptions of managers’ salaries from overall labor cost perceptions. We, therefore, diverge from the current literature by proposing an indirect effect of managers’ salaries on customers’ decisions in both preference and choice formation processes. Across different studies performed in different cultural environments, an adverse effect of managers’ salaries on customers’ decisions mediated by price fairness was found to be robust and generalized. Managerial implications are also discussed.
