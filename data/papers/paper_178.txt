2 - Extending Double Machine Learning: Graphical Causal Models in Marketing Sriniketh Vijayaraghavan, PhD Candidate, Wisconsin School of Business, Madison, WI Neeraj Arora Double Machine Learning (DML) has shown that we can get causal effects from observational data using plug-in machine learning methods. While this provides a significant leap in causal estimation, DML is valid only when we have conditional ignorability (or unconfoundedness). DML fails if there are any hidden confounds in the data generating process; this drawback of DML prevents its widespread application in empirical research. In this paper, we develop a novel machine  learning estimator that can recover causal effects consistently in the presence of hidden confounds. We do this by using Graphical Causal Models (GCM)—where we describe our data generating process as a directed acyclic graph—to identify the causal effects. Nonparametric identification of causal effects is much easier, and more scalable, using GCM than the potential outcomes framework. We use the efficient influence function for these identified causal effects to construct a machine learning estimator and call this estimator, ‘GraphDML’. Most marketing problems deal with endogeneity arising from unobserved confounds that bias the causal effects. Our method can incorporate these unobserved confounds into the data generating process and still recover consistent estimates. We then apply GraphDML to estimate the causal effect of email campaigns on conversions in a B2B setting that contains several hidden interactions that are unobserved to the researcher.
