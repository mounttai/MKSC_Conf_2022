2 - Discrete-choice Models and Representative Consumer Theory Joonhwi Joo, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX Kyeongbae Kim, Jean-Pierre H Dube Abstract We characterize the indirect utility function corresponding to a broad class of discrete-choice additive random-utility models of individual consumer behavior with perfect substitutes preferences and divisible goods. We then link this class of models to representative consumer theory. In particular, the aggregate demand function can be derived from a single representative consumer with a class of preferences that nests the CES model depending on the assumed distribution of random utility. We also show that the representative consumer is normative, facilitating aggregate welfare analysis for this same broad class of models. This linkage hinges on the divisibility of products. When products are indivisible, we show that integrability fails, indicating the lack of a representative consumer formulation for the pure discrete-choice model of demand. These findings should be of interest to the literatures in macro, trade and labor economics that use representative consumer models such as CES and its variants, insofar as the functional form assumption can be shown to be consistent with an empirically-relevant class of models of behavior that are routinely used in the discrete-choice analysis of micro data.
