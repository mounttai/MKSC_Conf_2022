99-cent pricing). We demonstrate that this categorization effect is present when people evaluate both outcomes and probabilities of prospects, leading to additional distortion in both the value and the probability weighting functions. We build and validate a categorization-based Prospect Theory model, integrating models of left-digit bias (DellaVigna 2009, Lacetera et al. 2012, Strulov-Shlain 2021) and the Prospect Theory model. We document an increased sensitivity to changes in subjective values and probability weights when crossing categorical boundaries, leading to discontinuous jumps in values and weights. As next steps, we plan to validate our model on multiple data sets spanning different literatures from finance, economics, and marketing.
