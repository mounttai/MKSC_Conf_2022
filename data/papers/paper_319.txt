1 - Consumer, Investor, and Philanthropist Mindsets of Crowdfunding Backers Hyunjung Crystal Lee, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain Mercedes Esteban Bravo, Jose Manuel Vidal Sans The current paper delves into different segments of crowdfunding backers based on their mindset, the basic traits underlying these mindset segments, and how the financial contribution to a project changes with their mindset. Based on empirical evidence from three studies, we demonstrate that potential sponsors can adopt six different mindsets: three pure cases that we describe as a consumer, investor, and philanthropist mindset, and three mixed cases that combine  the two of the mindsets. Then, we show how the mindset of potential backers can affect their financial response to a project. Lastly, we propose a general conceptual framework about these mindsets and how they are determined by combinations of four basic psychological traits (abstract- concrete, present-future, self-other, and trust-skepticism), conditioning them to place different emphasis on the perceived attributes of a crowdfunding project, thus on their valuation of and financial contribution to the project. The theory is validated by three empirical studies. The first study, a randomized factorial experiment, shows how the crowdfunding backers’ mindsets change their financial contribution amount depending on the specific attributes of crowdfunding project descriptions. The second study validates the psychological traits underlying the backers’ mindset. The third study demonstrates how the psychological distance between the constituents of backers’ mindset and the perceived presence of these traits in a project can explain the contribution amount. The results are relevant for crowdfunding platform managers and project creators, who can select or emphasize the most appropriate characteristics of a project for potential backers based on their mindset.
