1 - School Closures on Customer Acquisition in E-learning Karthik Kannan, Assistant Professor, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX Wayne Taylor We explore the how COVID-19 related public school closures and subsequent online learning usage, influenced adoption of complementary online learning resources. Using data from a national firm specializing in test preparation for gifted students, we seek to understand whether COVID-19 affected usage and more importantly how this change varied by socioeconomic factors, inferred by customer zip code. This has important implications for both marketers and at the policy level. Marketers from e-learning firms may be interested in understanding the extent to which COVID-19 and its impact on in-person public schooling cannibalized or inspired usage in other e-learning resources, both in terms of baseline adoption and revenue generation. At a broader policy level, we hope this research sheds light as to whether obtaining comfort with online learning tools has been a barrier to accessing other, potentially helpful, online learning resources for a variety of socioeconomic groups.
