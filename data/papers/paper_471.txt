4 - Modeling Dynamics in Sequential Search: The Effect of Product Recommendation Networks on Online Consumer Search and Purchase Qiang Zhang, Marketing Department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ), Shenzhen, China Yi Zhao A ubiquitous phenomenon in online commerce is that products are often hyperlinked through product-page recommendations, constituting a product recommendation network. These visible recommendation links could create dependence in the consumer search process such that searching one product may bring the recommended products closer to the consumer. This research proposes a structural model of consumer search and purchase in a product network allowing the search costs to change with the visible recommendations during the search process. In contrast with existing models that describe consumer search among a list of products, the proposed model describes consumer search dynamics inside a product network. We further propose a novel Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure to estimate the search model, avoiding high- dimensional integration and producing meaningful estimates of individual parameters. We apply the model to customer- level clickstream and transaction data from a durable category  in a large e-commerce platform. After properly controlling the endogeneity of the recommendation system, we quantify the economic value of sponsored recommendation links on product detail pages and infer the impact of alternative product recommendation strategies on welfare and revenue.
