1 - Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Made Online Shoppers Less Price Sensitive? Evidence from Amazon Lighting Deals Bingyang Fang, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY Chang Hee Park, Subimal Chatterjee We examine how the Covid-19 pandemic, that has severely restricted offline shopping, has changed consumers’ online shopping behavior in (a) their price sensitivity and (b) their reliance on quality cues. Our data covers 4,911 Lightning Deals offered by Amazon.com from December 2019 to September 2020, where consumers are enticed with deep discounts on a limited-stock promotion and have to decide quickly (e.g., 50% off in the next 24-hours, 25 left in stock). We split the data into a pre-Covid (from Dec.2019 to Feb.2020) and Covid (from Jul.2020 to Sep.2020) phase and examine how a focal product’s original price and discount offered (price features) along with the product ratings and number of customer reviews (quality features) affect the deal’s final claim percent (% of stock sold when the deal ends) across the two periods. We analyze the data using fixed-effect regression models and the Gaussian copula method to deal with the potential endogeneity of the price and discount rates. Our analysis shows the expected positive association of the final claim percentage with all four variables. However, we find that the advent of Covid significantly weakens the discount-rate to claim-percent relationship (showing less sensitivity to price) and strengthens the number-of-reviews to claim-percent relationship (showing more reliance on peer-generated buzz). We discuss the implications of our findings for retailers’ promotion management in a post-pandemic future.
