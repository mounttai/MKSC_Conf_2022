3 - How do Returns Impact Future Sales? Theory and Evidence Boram Lim, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS  , Kissan Joseph, Ram Janakiraman, Lauren Min Academic research has established the role of the option to return products in reducing consumers’ perception of risk in product buying. In this study, we investigate an unexplored, but important, question related to product returns: how does product returns incidence impact future buying behavior? We propose a conceptual model that delineates two distinct mechanisms by which return incidence can affect future sales. Return incidence makes the option to return products salient in the customer’s mind and increases the perceived utility of the retailer’s offering set, which then increases customer’s future spending. Return incidence also engenders customer gratitude, which in turn generates greater patronage with the retailer. We refer to these as salience and utilization and gratitude and reciprocation effects of product returns respectively. To test our hypotheses, we adopt a multi-method approach, one which leverages a panel dataset of 1727 offline grocery shoppers and laboratory data and difference- in-differences models. We offer important implications for theory and practice on the effect of customers’ decision to return products on their subsequent purchase behavior.
