3 - Regulatory Focus Shifts in Response to Arbitrary Temporal Boundaries: A Quasi- Experiment on Twitter David DeFranza, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT Promothesh Chatterjee Every day, individuals schedule events, make goals, and estimate the time remaining until a deadline occurs. For example, imagine the month is November, and a holiday sale is approaching in 15 days. Does the way consumers think about the event change if it falls on November 28 or December 2, all else being equal? We use distributed language models and more than five million tweets spanning 11 years to address this question. Our findings suggest a correlation between expressions of a promotion focus, more abstract language, and increasing prospective and retrospective distance from an event. In addition, the presence of a temporal border is associated with more distant construals for a given day, controlling for the objective distance to the event. We find that individuals show signs they consider events occurring at the beginning of the next month to be further away than those occurring at the beginning of the current month. Thus, while time is a necessary consideration, time itself is not interpreted objectively. Understanding this is important for the tasks outlined above, but also for managers, policy makers, and others establishing and enforcing deadlines. Moreover, introducing a new moderator, temporal borders, may be helpful for future researchers exploring regulatory and construal level theories and practitioners concerned with establishing a regulatory and construal level match in their communications. Finally, our work demonstrates the use of a powerful method which can be used to measure psychological constructs in natural language. This method will be of general interest to researchers and those concerned with understanding the attitudes and associations latent in text data.
