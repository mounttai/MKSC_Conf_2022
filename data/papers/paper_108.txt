3 - Smart Pricing Recommendations by Platforms Zuhui Xiao, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI Yi Zhu, Mark E Bergen Online platforms such as Airbnb increasingly provide smart pricing recommendations (SPR) based on AI technologies with the hope of facilitating market transactions between buyers and sellers. Platforms claim that SPR can help sellers find the right prices. Yet sellers often complain SPR as being too low. We believe exists behavioral reasons when underpriced SPR can be beneficial. We develop a game- theoretic model that incorporates behavioral factors in pricing in a cheap-talk setting and show when platforms will find it beneficial to provide selectively underpriced SPR to induce buyers and sellers to make a deal. As a result, the underpriced SPR, even though not fully informative, facilitate new exchanges that would be impossible with fully informative SPR. Our work broadens the understanding of platforms’ impacts in pricing and market exchange, and sheds new insights on platforms’ information provision in a world increasingly focused on big data and AI technologies.
