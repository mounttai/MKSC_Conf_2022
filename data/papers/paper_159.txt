2 - What Drives the Likelihood of Consumption After Purchase Henri Defoor, KU Leuven, Antwerpen, Belgium Kathleen Cleeren, Neomie Raassens, Jeff Inman Traditional economic theories assume that grocery purchases and consumption are perfectly in sync. However, in reality, consumers are often unable to align product purchases and consumption due to insufficient planning, impulses from the shopping environment, or poor food management. As a result, consumers may buy products they eventually do not consume. This raises the question which factors drive the likelihood of consumption after purchase. We have access to a unique single-source dataset which combines information from consumption diaries and purchase scanner data for the same panel of households (n = 4,677). Using a random- effects proportional hazard model, we examine the impact of product category-, household-, and purchase occasion characteristics, which are linked to product preference and cost considerations that consumers may have at the moment of consumption, on consumption likelihood. We find that the likelihood of consumption is 5.6% lower if a grocery product is purchased during a major shopping trip (compared to a fill-in trip) or 15.1% lower when the purchased product was on promotion (versus a regular priced product). If a product belongs to a product category typically bought for breakfast or a more utilitarian category, consumption likelihood is, respectively, 93.8% higher and 17.2% lower than for products that belong to other categories. Furthermore, products bought by larger households are less likely to be consumed, while experience with the product category increases the consumption likelihood. Our research also points out that a higher unit price and a larger package size increases consumption likelihood with, respectively, 6.1% and 15.7% per unit.
