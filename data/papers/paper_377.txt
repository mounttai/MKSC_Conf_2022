3 - Variety Matters: How Consumption Variety Affects Debt and Repayment Behavior Xiaodan Zhang, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China Maiju Guo The fast development of digital technology allows companies to access new sources to understand consumers and map out an outcome. Prior research has investigated how the classification of consumer purchases influences borrowing preferences, for example, identifying the physical longevity of purchases or experiential purchases as the drivers of debt decisions. However, whether and how the pattern of purchase influences consumers’ debt and repayment behavior remains an open question. This paper explores the influence of one pattern of consumer purchase, i.e., variety-seeking, on their subsequent debt and repayment behavior. Using a novel purchase record dataset from a large e-commerce platform, we construct a measure of consumption variety through the text analysis method. We assemble the consumption dataset with another dataset from a third-party lending platform based on the identifiable user id. Our empirical analysis suggests that consumers’ consumption variety substantially influences loan amount and default rate in the future. Specifically, we find that when consumers are more willing to seek variety, they are more likely to borrow more, and less likely to default. Moreover, we find that gender, hedonic purchase, the repayment plan (day vs. month), and the number of loan history moderate the interrelationship between consumption variety and the future debt and repayment behavior. This paper contributes to the literature linking consumer consumption behaviors to financial decision- making. Our findings shed important managerial insights on companies, which can utilize variety as an effective predictor of targeting and customer management.
