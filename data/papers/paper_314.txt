3 - Consumer Search and Product Returns Marat Ibragimov, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA John R Hauser, Siham El Kihal Online retailers are challenged by frequent product returns with $428 Billion in merchandise returned to US retailers in 2020 (National Retail Foundation 2021). Typically, product returns are studied in a purchase/post-purchase framework. However, online retailers have access to the information which precedes the purchase decision - consumer search. We demonstrate that this information provides a low-cost opportunity to better understand and predict product return behavior. Using data from a large European apparel retailer: (1) we document that adding consumer search behavior improves the prediction of product returns; (2) we find correlational evidence that using search filters, spending more time, and purchasing the last item searched are negatively associated with the probability of a return; (3) we propose an empirical-theoretical framework that jointly models consumer search, purchase, and returns decisions and estimate parameters on our data; (4) we use the proposed framework to test strategies of product return management which could help to improve profits and consumer satisfaction.
