1 - Does the Label Fit the Channel? The Effect of Shopping Online Versus In-store on Green and Ethical Purchases Emelie Fr√∂berg, Stockholm School of Economics, Stockholm, Sweden Sara Rosengren Our research investigates the impact of the shopping channel on purchases of sustainable products. Drawing on the concept of goal congruence, we suggest that the shopping  goals of consumers using different channels have varying degrees of congruence with the benefits offered by products with two different types of sustainability labels. Specifically, we argue that online shopping is more congruent with the benefits offered by utilitarian products with green labels, whereas in-store shopping fits better with the benefits of hedonic products with ethical labels. To overcome the gap between intention/attitude and behavior in the sustainability context, we rely on actual consumer purchases. We first conduct two studies, leveraging real-world grocery retailer datasets covering 400,000 purchases, which support the hypotheses based on our conceptual framework using (a) a quasi-experimental approach to study between-consumer effects and (b) analysis of a separate dataset to examine within-consumer effects. Moreover, in detailed exploratory analyses of within-consumer effects, we find that (a) the more utilitarian the shopping motivation and (b) the more utilitarian (or hedonic) benefits of the product category, the stronger effects. We also show that the choice of a product with or without a sustainability label depends on the shopping channel; goal congruence is key. Finally, we conduct a third study, leveraging a real-world beauty retailer dataset covering almost 480,000 purchases to test within-consumer effects based on hedonic shopping motivations. Again, the findings suggest that marketers who want to foster sustainable consumption will benefit from adapting their strategies to different shopping channels and sustainability labels.
