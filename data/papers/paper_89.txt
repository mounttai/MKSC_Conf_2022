3 - The Effect of Job Loss on Risky Decision Making Abigail Sussman, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, IL Samuel Hirshman, Daniel Oâ€™Leary, Jennifer Trueblood The unemployment rate in the  reached 14.7%, 23.1 million people, in 2020. While negative effects of unemployment on health and well-being are well-understood, the influence of recent job loss on decision-making has received little attention. Across a controlled experiment (n = 201) and a large-scale survey (n = 32,368), we find that job loss increases risky decision making. In Study 1, we develop a laboratory task to examine whether participants who lose the ability  to earn money are more likely to make risky decisions than participants assigned to a control group that continues to earn. This study is designed to establish the internal validity of the proposed causal relationship between a recent job loss and risky decision-making. In Study 2, we survey 32,368 respondents about their own employment status and examine the relationships among job loss and three measures of risky decision-making. This survey provides evidence corroborating the finding that recent job loss is associated with increased risk-taking in a context with greater external validity. Further, participants who have lost their jobs most recently make the riskiest decisions. These findings have consequential implications for policymakers as the decision to engage in risky behaviors can have negative long-term physical, financial, and psychosocial consequences.
