4 - How do Smart Citizens Favor Personal Data Markets under Surveillance Capitalism? Charles Light, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Yixuan Wang, Ranjan Pal, Bodhibrata Nag We investigate and rationalize how individuals in a surveilled developing economic society value a human-centric data economy (HCDE). We first design and conduct a non-online pilot field experiment on approximately 22500 human subjects across smart cities in India from 2014-2019, and collect data reflecting the impact of monetary incentives on these subjects to voluntarily trade their (personal) data  in the digital surveillance age. Consequently, we study how various degrees of incentive influence subject preferences - both, when they are, or are not well-informed about the commercial malpractices their personal data might be subjected to. We analyze and rationalize (from the viewpoint of behavioral economics) two main observations in general for the Indian population: (i) despite being warned of the commercial malpractices associated with their personal data in the mobile and IoT age, they prefer to trade data for incentives, and (ii) the willingness of individuals to trade personal data is statistically heavy-tailed, and hints at following a weak power-law. The broader social impact of such HCDEs lie on three fronts: (1) a society preferring HCDEs will likely enable high-quality personal data to be collected by online (social) applications in a trustworthy fashion that subsequently will catalyse a much-improved AI-driven multi-stakeholder targeted advertising business, (2) the GDP-centric macroeconomic inequality in a developing economy might considerably reduce due to online (social) application users earning from their personal data, and (3) much to the like of these application businesses, users will invest in increased time and meaningful attention to the former that will act as upward spiral feedbacks on improved personal data collection.
