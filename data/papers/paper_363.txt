3 - How to Sell Electric Vehicles?: The Impact of Direct Selling Zijun (June) Shi, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong Xubing Zhang, Ting Zhu, Mengze Shi In the multi-trillion automobile industry, advances in hardware and software technologies are increasingly common, especially in the growing market of electric vehicles (EV); however, when it comes to how to sell the cars, innovation has been scant. In recent years, direct selling has been especially attractive to newly entering EV makers. However, in the US, the decades-old state dealer protection laws restrict automakers to selling their products only through franchised dealers. EV makers (pioneered by Tesla) have been fighting for the right to directly distribute cars to consumers. Our research addresses several questions that sparked the heated debate among managers and policy makers: how direct selling would affect the market outcome for EV and other types of vehicles, how the entry of direct selling stores affects dealers in the market, and how direct selling may affect consumer welfare. We answer these questions using causal inference methods and data provided by a major automaker in China, where there is no legal restriction on direct selling in the automobile industry. This research delivers several managerial and policy implications. First, for countries/ regions that allow direct selling, our results provide empirical evidence of market outcomes of the entry of direct selling. Second, for manufacturers in countries/regions that do not allow it (e.g., many states in the U.S.), our findings shed light on whether a change in public policy is desirable. Third, for dealers, our findings can help them understand the impact of a direct-selling store thus aid their decision making on the selling efforts.
