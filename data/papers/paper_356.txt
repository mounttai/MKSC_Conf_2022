3 - Making a Smooth Exit? Menthol Bans and Cigarette Sales in Massachusetts Simha Mummalaneni, University of Washington, Seattle, WA Ali Goli, Pradeep Chintagunta Many public health regulators have advocated for a ban on menthol-flavored cigarettes because they are believed to be more dangerous than traditional non-menthol cigarettes. However, these bans will have limited benefits if consumers are able to circumvent them. We examine this issue by evaluating the effects of a statewide menthol ban that was instituted by Massachusetts in 2020. An examination of store-level retail sales data from Massachusetts indicates that some demand shifted from menthols to non-menthols after the ban was instituted, thereby supporting the goals of the ban. However, broadening our analysis to neighboring states  shows a sharp increase in menthol sales in areas just outside the Massachusetts border, thereby suggesting that many Massachusetts residents were able to get around the ban by engaging in cross-state shopping for menthol cigarettes. The net result of this behavior is that the Massachusetts menthol ban reduced menthol consumption by about 50 percent and did not significantly reduce total cigarette sales. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for cross-state purchases when measuring the effects of menthol bans, and they also provide policymakers with guidance regarding the benefits of a national ban vs. statewide bans.
