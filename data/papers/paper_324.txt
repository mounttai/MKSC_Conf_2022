4 - Sequential Search Models: A Pairwise Maximum Rank Approach Jiarui Liu, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL This paper studies a generalized sequential search model that allows for endogeneity and unknown distribution of consumers’ match value. Endogeneity arises when unobserved product quality affects both consumer choices and product observed characteristics (e.g. price or rankings on online search intermediaries). Ignoring endogeneity when it is present, or misspecifying the match value distribution leads to biased estimates of preferences and search costs. A likelihood approach to estimate the generalized model gives biased results. Therefore, I propose a new estimator - pairwise maximum rank (PMR) estimator - for both preference and search cost parameters. I show that the PMR estimator is consistent using only data on consumers’ search order within any pair of products rather than data on consumers’ full consideration set or final purchase. Additionally, we can use the PMR estimator to test for the true match value distribution in the data. In the empirical application, I apply the PMR estimator to quantify the effect of rankings in Expedia hotel search using two samples of the data set, to which consumers are randomly assigned. One sample has endogenous rankings, and the other sample has randomly generated rankings. I find the position effect to be 0.11-0.36 usd, and the effects estimated using the two samples are similar.
