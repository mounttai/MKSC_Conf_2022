2 - Leveraging the Power of Images in Managing Product Return Rates John R Hauser, MIT, Cambridge, MA Daria Dzyabura, Siham El Kihal, Marat Ibragimov In online channels, products are returned at high rates. Shipping, processing, and refurbishing are so costly that a retailer’s profit is extremely sensitive to return rates. In many product categories, such as the $500 billion fashion industry, experiments in real time are not feasible because the fashion season is over before sufficient return data are observed. We demonstrate that posted fashion-item images enhance return-rate selection of assortments. We develop three interconnected models: (1) a machine-learning model to predict return rates using images and other data available prelaunch. The model predicts well; robustness tests suggest it’s hard to find a better-predicting model, (2) an optimal policy to maximize profit given the imperfect predictive model, and (3) an interpretable model based on automatically-extracted image-processing features. The model provides valuable insights with which to select and design fashion items for the website. Using data from a large European retailer (over 1.2 million transactions for nearly 10,000 fashion items), we demonstrate that machine-learning methods are practical, scale to large collections and repeated fashion seasons, and improve profit relative to models using non-image data. We illustrate visually how automatically- extracted features affect return rates. Finally, we illustrate how data available postlaunch help manage return rates.
