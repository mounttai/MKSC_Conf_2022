11- The Heterogeneous Impact of Discount Coupons on Customer In-app Behaviors: Evidence from Field Experiment and Causal Forests Miyeon Jung, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV Seoungwoo Lee, Shiny Ahn, Daegon Cho The majority of customers nowadays go through the purchase funnel entirely on mobile in many product categories, and a growing number of retailers deploy a mobile-first strategy that prioritizes serving them. This paper investigates the effectiveness of mobile coupons that may vary across the purchase funnel stages in which these mobile-only customers are located. The authors conducted a randomized field experiment with a major fashion retailer in Korea and found differential impacts of coupons across the funnel stages in a causal manner. They found that customers in the middle stage, who show a moderate level of interest in a product by putting it in a wishlist, respond positively to a coupon. A better coupon that offers a deeper discount makes customers in the early stages increase their purchase likelihood, but the better coupon has no impact in the late stage. Also, the authors measured the heterogeneous effects of the coupons within each funnel stage by utilizing the Causal Forest method with very detailed in-app behavior data. While certain degrees of heterogeneity exist in every stage of the funnel, the customers in the middle stage show the highest level of heterogeneity. Further, the authors identified customer behaviors associated with positive heterogeneous effects; specifically, they found that 1) adding and then removing a product from a wishlist and 2) searching a product on the appâ€™s home screen are the customer behaviors positively associated with higher purchase likelihoods. The results and their simulation analysis indicate that retailers can substantially improve coupon effectiveness by individually targeting customers in the middle stage of the purchase funnel based on their past in-app behaviors.
