3 - Permanent Income and Marketing Outcomes Randolph E Bucklin, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA Rafael Becerril The marketing literature has documented that the income elasticities of marketing outcomes tend to be relatively small, suggesting that income may not be an important driver of consumer behavior. On the other hand, marketing practitioners attribute a more significant role to consumer income. We explore whether income effects on marketing outcomes are significantly larger when measured in terms of permanent income instead of reported income, as in the consumer panel data typically available to marketers. To compute permanent income, we rely on a standard method in macroeconomics and adapt it for use on Nielsen Homescan panelists. We find that, unlike reported income, permanent income predicts marketing outcomes such as basket size, the number of products and brands in the basket, the proportion of expenditure allocated to produce, and use of coupon. We estimate the permanent income elasticity of grocery expenditure to be 0.37, whereas the reported-income elasticity estimate is 0.05.
