1 - Residual Heterogeneity within Targeted Digital Audiences Matthew McGranaghan, University of Delaware, Wilmington, DE Marcel Preuss Advertisers participate in advertising auctions by choosing a target audience, a bid type (pay-per-impression or pay-per- action), and bid amount, resulting in a reached audience. We show how unspecified and unspecifiable attributes of the reached audience depend not only on the target audience, but also on the bid type and bid amount. Unspecified attributes refer to attributes that the advertiser could have targeted but did not target. Unspecifiable attributes refer to attributes that the advertiser cannot target (e.g., intention to buy). We run novel experiments on a social media platform that allow us to measure the otherwise unobservable composition of a reached audience along unspecified and unspecifiable attributes, and document how bid type and bid amount systematically affect the composition of a reached audience. Optimal bidding in this environment is thus complicated by the bid type and bid amount influencing the value of the reached audience.
