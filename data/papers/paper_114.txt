3 - Endorsement Portfolios of Social Media Influencers Lisa Zäuner, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany , Simone Wies, Alexander Bleier, Alexander Edeling Brands increasingly rely on social media influencers to promote their products because consumers tend to perceive such endorsements as less commercial than brand ads. However, influencers can engage in various collaborations, for instance across several categories and with multiple brands, which may lead their activities to be perceived as more commercial. As a result, such influencers’ effectiveness to generate engagement with their sponsored content may suffer. This research examines the relationship between four characteristics of influencers’ endorsement portfolios (number of endorsed categories, number of brands within each category, simultaneous versus sequential collaborations, and fit of other non-brand-related posts) and the effectiveness of their influencer marketing activities. The results help influencers effectively manage their endorsement portfolios as well as brands to determine which influencers to collaborate with.
