2 - Technology Adoption, Customer-connecting and Back-office Business Model Digitalization for Start-up Performance Willem Smit, Asia School of Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Erkko Autio, Kun Fu Recently, much research attention has shifted towards business model (BM) digitalization and marketing; however, the treatments of this topic have lacked nuance. As BM digitalization is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon, it is important to differentiate the various mechanisms through which it can create value for customers and the firm. Our model theorizes and tests four different value-driving mechanisms digital technology adoption and BM application can have on firm performance. We hypothesize the first mechanism is driven by novel combinations of digital technologies. The second and third mechanisms are related to the extent to which digital technologies have been applied in back-end and customer- connecting business model activities. Finally, BM digitalization enables business model experimentation which in turn improves business performance.To empirically explore the value-driving contributions from BM digitalization dimensions, we surveyed 685 ’digital entrepreneurs’ in six Southeast Asian countries to test these in a cross-national and emerging market context. We perform regression and mediation analyses to test the hypotheses. Our analyses distinguish between ‘customer-connecting’ and ‘backbone’ digitalization  in start-up business models and show that while both drive operational and competitive (against peers) performance, it is backbone digitalization that drives performance through business model experimentation and digital technology adoption. Customer-connecting digitalization appears to have become a given but is not associated with digital adoption- driven competitive advantage.
