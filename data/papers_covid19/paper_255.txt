2 - Does Price Discount Satisfy Consumers and Lead Them to Consume Efficiently? Yeji Lim, California State University, Fullerton, CA Kyungsik Nam This paper proposes a consumer’s dynamic utility maximization model with inequality constraint when firms adopt a tiered pricing scheme to promote efficient electricity consumption. There have been only a few relevant marketing literatures for electricity price because electricity conceptually tends to be considered a public good. However, electricity is a private good in the sense that consumers should pay for their consumption, and firms need to satisfy consumers with their service. As consumers have been working at home for the last two to three years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, moreover, consumers’ dependency on electricity has been increased. Since even policymakers have interests and concern the stable supply to maintain the quality of the consumer’s life, the firms’ problem in this market has become more complicated. To solve the firms’ pricing, profit maximization, and consumer retention, it is critical to understand how consumers behave under the tiered pricing with an energy efficiency program. Using the large empirical data extracted from the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) of the Republic of Korea, we analyze the consumers’ dynamic model and estimate the consumers’ behavioral choices over time. We find that consumers’ utility turns out to be higher when the marginal price is lower than the satisfaction factor for electricity consumption. Also, we find that the pricing discount cannot lead consumers to consume electrics efficiently in the long run, although firms discount marginal prices for efficient consumption.
