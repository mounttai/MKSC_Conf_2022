3 - Do School Nutrition Mandates Affect Household Food Purchases? Michael Patrick Palazzolo, University of California, Davis, CA Zhiying Hu, Adithya Pattabhiramaiah, Kusum L Ailawadi In 2012, a provision of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) placed strict requirements on what types of foods could be offered at schools, increasing the healthiness of food available to students. Did changes to the healthiness of school meals, even in the absence of more generous meal subsidies, lead parents to substitute towards school meals, and away from purchasing meals for their kids from  supermarkets? We document that these changes did lead parents to purchase less food at the supermarket. Moreover, much of the reduction in food purchased from the supermarket appears to come from food categories traditionally associated with breakfast or lunch-the two meals for which food can easily be purchased from schools. We document differences in these effects along different dimensions, such as household demographics and taste for nutritious food. We also explore the existence of unintended consequences, such as a decline in the nutritional quality of supermarket food purchases. Our findings contribute to our understanding of how consumers make healthy eating choices. Often, we study such choices in the context of differentially priced goods-e.g., between a cheaper, less- healthy option and a more expensive, healthier option-or the introduction of new healthy goods-e.g., entry of new supermarkets or brands. The HHFKA provides a unique opportunity for studying what happens when the healthiness of existing food options improves. Our findings indicate that, all else equal, improvements in the healthiness of available foods offered in one avenue (schools) can encourage a substitution of household purchases away from other avenues (such as supermarkets).
