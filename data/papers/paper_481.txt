1 - Sharing Bike-sharing and Car-sharing: An Empirical Analysis Yiqi Li, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI Puneet Manchanda, Emanuel Schuster, Martin Spann Bike-sharing and car-sharing are important components of the Sharing Economy. However, it is not clear whether these two are complements or substitutes. Using data from a company that offers both modes (though under different brands), we propose a Nested-Logit structural approach to analyze how nearby cars (bikes) affect bike (car) sharing demand at the station-level. Besides, we also examine the behavior  of individuals who use both car-sharing and bike-sharing. The results show that more cars (bikes) reduce the bike (car) sharing demand nearby, especially for car-sharing. Overall, our results suggest that bike-sharing and car-sharing are substitutes to each other respect to the number of bookings. Our findings are likely to be helpful to sharing economy companies, city planners and policymakers.
