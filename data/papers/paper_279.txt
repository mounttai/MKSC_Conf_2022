1 - Does Carrying News Increase Non-news Views for Social Media Platforms?  Yu Song, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Puneet Manchanda With the rapid growth of online news aggregators, the debate on whether news aggregators should pay news publishers for redistributing their content has become very salient. However, there is little understanding of the impact of carrying news on news aggregators, especially for their non-news content. Our research fills this gap by examining the impact of news on non-news user engagement and content generation on Facebook. We leverage a natural experiment, Facebookâ€™s Australian news shutdown, to estimate this using both an event study and a difference-in-differences analysis. We find that both user engagement and content generation of non-news content on Facebook decreased after the news shutdown. We also find that these effects were more pronounced for more influential, socially active, experienced, and verified accounts. These results suggest positive spillover effects of news content on non-news content. A simple quantification exercise shows that the impact of carrying news is economically significant for a platform like Facebook. Our results provide timely and relevant implications for regulators and social media platforms.
