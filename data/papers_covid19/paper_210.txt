3 - Grocery Store Closures and Household Nutritional Choices Sylvia Hristakeva, UCLA Anderson School of Managment, Los Angeles, CA Julia Levine Health practitioners and researchers link consumer dietary choices to health outcomes, highlighting the importance for improved understanding of what drives consumer nutrition. Differences in households’ nutritional choices are likely driven by both demand and supply factors. We add to our understanding of supply-side factors, analyzing how access grocery stores may impact households’ food purchases and the nutritional composition of food baskets. Our analyses exploit a novel variation in supply availability— temporary closures of grocery stores, which occur right after a hurricane passes through the geographic location. We identify households as treated if they frequented a closed store in the pre-hurricane period. We find that a temporary closure of a grocery store results in a decrease in purchases of healthy food for treated households relative to the control group. The impact on nutritional intake is large and persists for six months following the store re-opening, despite no contemporaneous effects on overall grocery expenditure. Next, we explore potential mechanisms for our main results, finding that treated households direct a larger share of their food expenditures to discount stores, even after the store has reopened. Hence, differences in prices and/or assortments across grocery and discount stores may explain the estimated changes in the composition of household purchase baskets.
