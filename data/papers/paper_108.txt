3 - The Voice of Customers in Customization Liang Guo, Chinese Univesity of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China Recent years have seen a growth in the production capability and the demand for customized products and services. As a prerequisite for customization, private information on individual customer’s quality preference needs to be uncovered. Sellers can listen to customers about their stated or self-reported preferences through direct communication (e.g., conversation, survey). Alternatively, customer preferences can be inferred from their behavior when they are given the rights to self-design the quality. Yet customers may misrepresent their stated/inferred preferences to strategically manipulate the customization process. In this research we endogenize the viability of customization by investigating whether and when customers may reveal their quality preferences truthfully. We find that, for either preference-learning approach, customers would voice their preferences faithfully if and only if they are sufficiently heterogenous. Equilibrium preference revelation, and hence endogenous customization, tend to be sustained  by intermediate seller bargaining power or non-extreme production/design costs. We also examine how the preference-learning approaches may differ in the endogenous feasibility of customization, equilibrium qualities, and the parties’ expected payoffs. We show that giving up the design right need not always be harmful for the seller, and gaining it can make the buyers worse off, especially when fixed costs of customization are considered.
