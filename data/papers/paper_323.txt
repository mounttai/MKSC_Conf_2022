2 - Dual Role of Price in Consumer Choice Sungjee Choi, PhD Candidate, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA Gary J Russell Consumers commonly trade off price and quality in their purchase decisions. However, consumers cannot easily judge quality. In these circumstances, consumers use price as a quality cue to alleviate uncertainty in their decision- making process. The goal of the study is to understand the relationship between price and quality. The key assumption in this study is consumers believe that there is a positive correlation between price and quality. For this reason, price serves a dual role -- both as a constraint on choice and as a signal of product quality. Because these two effects work in opposite directions, consumers are expected to exhibit relatively less price sensitivity in the presence of a price-quality association (P-Q). Moreover, higher-priced  brands should be expected to face a relatively less elastic demand in the presence of a P-Q association. To examine these predictions, we develop a choice model that allows for P-Q associations to impact consumer price response. The model is applied to scanner data choice histories in the margarine product category. Results imply that the strength of the P-Q association varies across the consumer population. Consumers who have a strong P-Q association are not as price sensitive as consumers who have a weak P-Q association. This suggests that variation in P-Q strength moderates the demand elasticity facing high-priced brands. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research.
