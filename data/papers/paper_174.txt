4 - Addiction and Alcohol Tax: Evidence from Japanese Beer Industry Kosuke Uetake, Yale School of Management, New Haven, CT Masakazu Ishihara, Makoto Mizuno, Kohei Hayashida We study the effects of taxation and regulation on addictive alcohol consumption. Exploiting the changes in tax policies and sales regulation in the Japanese beer market, we examine how consumers react to the policy changes by adjusting their alcohol consumption and by substituting to different categories with different alcohol content. We first show some descriptive evidence that consumers (i) are addictive to alcohol, (ii) are responsive to tax policies and regulation, and (iii) substitute to cheaper categories in response to policy changes. These findings lead us to estimate a dynamic structural model of alcohol purchase and consumption where consumers choose both categories and amount. Also, multiple policy changes allow us to identify the consumerâ€™s time-inconsistent preference in addition to preference for addiction to alcohol. Using the estimated model, we examine alternative alcohol policy designs.
