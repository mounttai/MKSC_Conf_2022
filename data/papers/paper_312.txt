4 - Linking Color Palettes to Brand Attributes Daria Dzyabura, New Economic School, Moscow, Russian Federation Renana Peres Visual design, a key element across the marketing mix, is conducted largely using qualitative principles. While many marketing decisions are increasingly made using quantitative metrics, and most recently artificial intelligence algorithms, visual design is done by graphic designers, who follow  generally accepted artistic and aesthetic principles. In this research we quantitatively map the relationship between colors and brand attributes. We collect consumersâ€™ visual collage representation of their associations with a brand, as well as their perception of that brand. We use a two step approach to extract colors from the collages in a way that is rich enough to allow for nonlinearity, combinations of different colors, and different shades of colors, but at the same time tractable enough to regress on brand attributes. We first reduce the original color RGB space of 16 million colors (256^3) by grouping colors in the CIE wavelength space so that very similar shades of one color are grouped together. Second, we run LDA on the resulting 512 colors, which generates the color equivalent of topics - combinations of colors that appear together and therefore represent a thematic meaning. We then regress the frequencies of color palettes in the collages on brand attributes, as rated by the same respondents. This regression indicates which color palettes are positively or negatively associated with each brand characteristic. Finally, we validate the results by showing participants otherwise identical ads colored in each of the color palettes. We find that the resulting brand perceptions match those predicted by our model.
