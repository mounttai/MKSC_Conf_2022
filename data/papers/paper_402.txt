3 - Role of Concreteness in Multimodal Communication Amrita Dey, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT Tianyu Gu, Yu Zhu, Stephen Carson There is an increasingly higher dependence on a combination of multiple forms of media (textual, visual, and meta information), among marketers, to promote their products and services. So far, there has been significant academic interest in the concreteness of textual elements and their role in communication. However, there is very little understanding of how visual concreteness and its metrics play a role, despite visual communication being a critical component in communication. Also, the perspective to include a comprehensive and integral account of measuring concreteness is missing from the literature. In this study, we address these issues and study the role of image concreteness and text-image information fit in the context of online crowdfunding. We employ novel methodologies for a long-tailed object detection approach based on MASK RCNN and LVIS along with a combination of object detection, word embedding and high-dimensional text comparison techniques to assess the fit between text and image.Our findings show that concreteness benefits crowdfunding success at both text and image levels, although the concreteness of the project title has a negative effect. Also, we find that a high fit between text and image information improves the performance of crowdfunding projects. An additional survey among respondents from the Prolific platform further validates our findings.
