3 - Artificially Intelligent Marketplaces: Back- testing Trading Bots in Peer-to-peer Markets Pavel Kireyev, INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France Ruiqi Lin Peer-to-peer marketplaces have become ubiquitous. Increasingly, individual actors and the platforms themselves are implementing artificially intelligent bots to buy and resell items in these marketplaces to generate profits from the transactions. However, limited evidence exists of the profitability of these attempts, with some evidence of failures (e.g., Zillowâ€™s iBuying for homes). We develop a statistical framework for back-testing trading bots in peer- to-peer marketplaces and apply the model to an emerging marketplace for nonfungible tokens (NFTs). We show that bidding bots that adopt the strategy of submitting a large number of low bids on listings and reselling at higher prices can be profitable, whereas buying bots that attempt to identify underpriced items, purchase them for their listed prices, and then resell, are unlikely to be profitable. Our  framework presents an approach to evaluate counterfactual historical outcomes in markets for illiquid items, allows for hyperparameter tuning to improve bot profitability, and can help market participants test different bot strategies.
