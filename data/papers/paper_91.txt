2 - Consumer Choice and Corporate Bankruptcy Megan Kelly Hunter, Boston College, Carroll School of Management, Chestnut Hill, MA Samuel Antill Using incentivized randomized experiments, we estimate the causal effect of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on consumer demand for the bankrupt firm’s products. Knowledge of a firm’s Chatper 11 bankruptcy reduces consumers’ willingness- to-pay by 18-35%, depending on the industry. We show evidence that consumers fear both (i) a liquidation preventing future relationships with a firm and (ii) a decline in quality while a firm reorganizes. Estimating a structural model of consumer demand, we quantify the large negative impact of bankruptcy on market share and consumer welfare.
