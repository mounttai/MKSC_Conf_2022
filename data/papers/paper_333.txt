1 - Is it How You Start How You Finish? Customer Return Rate Evolution Over Time Tulin Erdem, New York University, New York, NY Siham El Kihal, Christian Schulze Do customers’ product return rates evolve over time? If so, what influences this evolution and how do previous experiences with an online retailer as well as customer- specific characteristics impact evolution patterns across customers? Moreover, what is the implication of this evolution on profits? This article provides answers to these questions. The results show that (1) the majority of customers exhibit increasing return rates over time, (2) purchase feedback (e.g., customers’ learning about product quality and fit) decreases return rates, (3) there is a strong positive state dependence in customer return rates as current return rate is an increasing function of past return rates, implying learning about the return process and habit formation, (4)socio-demographic and psychographic customer characteristics do not have a substantial impact on customer return rates, and (5) customers with an increasing return rate are 40% less profitable in the first year and 50% less profitable after five years than customers with a decreasing return rate. These findings highlight the need for managers to consider customer return rates evolution in their decision making.
