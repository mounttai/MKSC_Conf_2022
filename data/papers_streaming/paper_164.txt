1 - Theorizing the Influencer Industrial Complex Gillian Brooks, Kingâ€™s Business School, London, United Kingdom The marketing industry has seen a shift in how consumers discover new products. The rise of social media influencers has fundamentally changed the consumer decision journey and marketers are struggling to find their place in this evolving landscape (Childers, Lemon & Hoy 2019). The influencer marketing industry is projected to be worth $26.4 billion by 2025 (Mansour 2020) and has given rise to new pathways for everyday individuals to accrue media attention, which can be translated into promotional endeavours (Brooks, Drenten and Piskorski 2021). The rise of influencer marketing has gained recognition in various academic literatures, which had previously focused on opinion leaders and market mavens (Goldenberg, Lehmann, Shidlovski & Barak 2006; Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet 1944), influence through celebrity endorsements (Dwivedi, McDonald and Johnson 2014) influence through word-of-mouth marketing (Chae, Stephen, Bart and Yao 2015; Hughes, Swaminathan and Brooks 2019) or testimonials in advertising (Martin, Wentzel and Tomczak 2008). Recently, scholars have developed a more robust understanding of who these online influencers are (Brooks, Drenten and Piskorski 2021; De Vierman, Cauberghe and Hudders 2017) but minimal research has examined this precarious system. Our study seeks to provide a systematic review of what we have termed the Influencer Industrial Complex - the evolving infrastructure and the key players that have created this unique space. We ask specifically: how has this industry evolved into a multi-level marketing scheme, and who are the key players that structure it?
