3 - Digitizing High-touch Interactions: The Divided Efficacy in Personal Selling James Reeder, Purdue University - Krannert School of Management, West Lafayette, IN  , Mohammad Saifur Rahman We study how digitization affects the efficacy of high-touch interactions, specifically by looking at the relative value of in- person versus virtual interactions (e.g., WebEx, Facetime). In a direct sales context, our empirical strategy exploits a pseudo- random experiment performed on 14,897 clients overseen by agents of a large medical device firm. A subset of agents switched from entirely using in-person visits (IPV) to a mix of remote visits (RV) and IPV. By studying the contemporaneous and spillover effects of RV and IPV, we find that, on average, IPV represents more than double the value of RV. However, in tech-savvy regions, the gap between the effectiveness of an IPV versus an RV reduces significantly. Further, smaller clients are less responsive to RV compared to larger clients, indicating a digital divide based on client size. Last, by studying the dynamic effects of RV and IPV, we find that a pulsing strategy drives the value of IPV even higher if used in conjunction with RV.
