2 - Semantic Properties of Writing Predict Academic Success Olivier Toubia, Columbia Business School, New York, NY Jonah Berger What does writing reveal about the writer? We suggest that the semantic properties of writing samples can predict academic success. Using 25,000 student essays from a large public university, we find that even controlling for a variety of relevant factors (i.e., SAT scores and parent education) semantic progression predicts GPA. Our results are particularly surprising given that we focus on students who were already admitted and enrolled, at which point  college admissions essays have no direct relation to success. We argue that written output reflects the author’s associative abilities, which have been shown to be related to their creative abilities, which in turn have been shown to be related to academic success. We find that the most successful students tend to write essays that cover a lot of ground (as measured by the volume occupied by the essay in a latent semantic space) without moving too fast (as measured by the speed with which the essay moves in the latent semantic space). We argue that the ability to cover a lot of ground reflects the student’s dissociative ability (the ability to access mutually remote associative elements) and that the ability to do so without excessive movement in the latent semantic space reflects associative ability (the ability to combine remote concepts in an adequate way). The combination of dissociate and associative ability has been shown to predict convergent and divergent thinking abilities, two creative capabilities that are linked to academic success.
