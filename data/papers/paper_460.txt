3 - The Spillover Effect of Product Defects in Buyer-supplier Networks Hoorsana Damavandi, Ivey Business School, Western University, London, ON, Canada  Kersi Antia, Vivek Astvansh, Stefan Wuyts Product defects are a common occurrence in buyer-supplier relationships, typically resulting in a decline in the dollar value of the at-fault supplier’s relationship with the affected buyer. The present study assesses the spillover effect of a supplier’s product defects on its relationship with its other non-affected buyers. Building on the problem-solving framework in operations management, the authors hypothesize how this spillover effect may be strengthened or weakened by the information available to these other non-affected buyers regarding the problem underlying the defect and its available solutions. They conceptualize problem-related information as being available from the Simmelian ties (cliques) involving the focal non-affected buyer, the at-fault supplier, and other buyers/suppliers in the network. In contrast, the authors expect non-affected buyers to infer the availability of solutions from the number of tier-2 suppliers the at-fault supplier has ties with. They expect more information about the problem (solution) to exacerbate (attenuate) the negative spillover effect, and importantly, for these effects to be nonlinear. Relying on a data set comprising a multi-tier network of relationships among 13 automotive manufacturers, their 111 tier-1 suppliers, and 1927 tier-2 suppliers observed over two years, the authors estimate a significant decline in the value of an at-fault supplier’s relationship with its non-affected buyers. They also provide evidence of clear nonlinear strengthening and weakening effects for Simmelian ties and the at-fault supplier’s count of tier-2 suppliers respectively. These findings contribute to the nascent yet growing body of knowledge on multi-tier buyer-supplier networks in marketing.
