2 - The Impact Of The Covid-19 Pandemic On The Nutritional Quality Of Food Purchases Ricardo Montoya, Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile Andres Elberg, Francisca Grandon, Cristian Dagnino  In recent years, health institutions have increased their warnings about serious diseases related to the mounting consumption of ultra-processed foods with low nutritional quality. Accordingly, several countries have improved their regulations and introduced more and better information (e.g., warning labels) to educate consumers to prefer (avoid) products with high (low) nutritional quality. Recently, the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic changed people’s lives in multiple dimensions. Among these dimensions, the pandemic might have affected the nutritional quality of food purchases. On the one hand, increased health concerns may have improved the healthfulness of consumers’ choices. On the other hand, the economic and psychological consequences of such an environmental shock may have caused consumers to shift their purchases towards less healthful choices. In this research, we investigate how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the consumption of macronutrients in a large panel of consumers. We combine individual-level transactional data from a big-box supermarket chain with the nutritional information of products collected by a third- party company. We analyze purchases before and during the Covid-19 pandemic to quantify the effect and determine whether this effect is heterogeneous across the population. We analyze heterogeneity due to, for instance, economic status, change in living conditions, or proneness to healthy consumption in the past.
