1 - Pump Priming Markets at the Base of the Pyramid: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Push vs. Pull Strategies in Rural India Gaurav Mehta, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany , Rajesh Chandy, Werner J Reinartz, Om Narasimhan This paper offers new insights on the marketing of new socially beneficial product categories to rural emerging market communities. Such categories are those where it  is not even clear that demand exists (often due to lack of awareness), and a thriving marketplace of transactions most assuredly does not. We introduce the concept of pump priming: the stimulation of sales of a product category through early investments in marketing activities that educate consumers about problems created by current behaviours, and the advantages of new consumption behaviours. The ability to prime the pump for socially beneficial products could help address market failures that are often prevalent at the bottom of pyramid. We study the concept of pump priming through a randomized controlled trial involving 25,200 households in 240 rural villages in Uttar Pradesh, India. We specifically examine the impact of two marketing approaches that are particularly salient to such contexts and compare them to the traditional approach of selling through retail shops:a) community pull, defined as marketing efforts that seek to influence purchase and use behaviour among consumers through activities and events that draw large groups from the community (e.g., community rallies).b) consumer push, defined as marketing efforts that incentivize and support the targeting of specific segments of consumers to purchase and use products from new categories, with the expectation that these consumers will in turn influence others. Results suggest that direct marketing approaches involving consumer push and community pull marketing significantly outperform the traditional marketing approaches and could potentially help in address market failures that hinder the adoption of socially beneficial products.
