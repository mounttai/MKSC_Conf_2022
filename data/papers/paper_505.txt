1 - Application of Volumetric Choice Experiments in a Marketing Context Towhidul Islam, PhD, University of Guelph, Canada, Guelph, ON, Canada Richard Carson, Thomas Eagle, Jordan Louviere Volumetric Choice Experiments (VCEs) are designed to capture purchase quantities and can be seen as an extension of Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) where individuals decide how many units of a specific good or service to buy/ use rather than deciding whether to buy/use it or not. VCEâ€™s produce data in the form of integer counts rather than the binary or multinomial discrete choices. VCE presents new opportunities to study a range of behavior of interest to marketers and interesting challenges in implementing them. Like DCEs, VCEs have different components ranging from experimental design to modelling. Our focus here is on laying out the overall process of implementation rather than detailed analysis of specific components. Our empirical examples come from large-scale VCEs embedded in surveys administered to samples drawn from Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) consumer panel: canned tuna and single serve-coffee K-pods. The response takes the form of planned purchase counts, possibly zero. Our VCE designs allows for statistical identification of own- (brand by size) and cross-price elasticities, plus the effects of other attributes and demographics and their interactions with prices. Our planned purchase counts are fit using a negative binomial regression with a multilevel mixed-effects specification. We examine the external validity of our approach by comparing our estimates to those derived using actual canned tuna data purchases from the same IRI panelists. We concluded by suggesting general classes of behavior VCEs might be useful in predicting and discuss some unresolved research issues.
