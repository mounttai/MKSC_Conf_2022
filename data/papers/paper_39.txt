3 - When Apps Ask to Track Michelle Andrews, Emory University, Atlanta, GA Kyeongbin Kim, David A Schweidel We leverage a recent change to the iOS mobile operating system that requires apps to request usersâ€™ permission to collect their tracking data. We use location data from more than 7 million devices to examine the impact of the change. We find the frequency of data collection is reduced and the distribution of locations at which devices are detected shifts, suggesting a possible bias in future data collected. Though the policy change reduces the data that providers collect, we show how this can be addressed by using unaffected individuals to infer the behavior of affected individuals. We derive implications for future research on privacy.
