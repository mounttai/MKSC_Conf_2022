3 - Behind the Badge: The Influence of Badged Reviewer Status and Emotional-cognitive Writing Style on Opinion About Hedonic and Utilitarian Products  Shyam Gopinath, Indiana University Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, IN Elham Yazdani, Steve Carson In this research we examine the role of reviewer badges in the spread of opinion in online reviewer communities. Using data covering a two-year period of 458,305 reviews for products in both hedonic and utilitarian categories on Amazon.com, we find that prior ratings from badged reviewers have a smaller influence across all reviewers than ratings from non- badged reviewers. When distinguishing between badged and non-badged new reviewers, we find that ratings from badged reviewers have an inverse effect on ratings awarded by subsequent non-badged reviewers whereas ratings from non-badged reviewers positively influence subsequent ratings from all reviewers. The stronger influence of non-badged reviewers is particularly pronounced for hedonic products, reflecting a better fit with the emotional style in which they are shown to write and the fact that they alter their writing style more when reviewing hedonic products than badged reviewers do. In contrast, ratings from badged reviewers have a positive effect only on the opinions of subsequent badged reviewers and this within-group contagion is especially strong for utilitarian products. Implications for the design of influencer strategies and the study of individual review generation processes are discussed.
