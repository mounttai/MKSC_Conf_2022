2 - The Impact of Source and Content Attributes of New Product Information Leakages on Firm Value Mahdi Niknejad, University of Texas At Austin, Austin, TX Vijay Mahajan New Product information leakages (NPLs) have become more common in recent years, forcing firms to put vast resources into security practices. However, little is known about the impact of these leakages on firm value. This study is an examination of stock market reactions to new product leakages in high-tech consumer markets. The authors also consider the moderating roles of leaker characteristics and leakage content. The results suggest that on average, investors react positively to new product leakages. The abnormal returns are greater when there are more leakers publishing NPLs, resulting in diffusion of more information about the firmâ€™s R&D activities. Moreover, the number of trustworthy leakers positively influences abnormal returns. Leakers who are of higher status or those with whom the investors are more familiar generate more positive response in the stock market as well. In addition, the characteristics of leakage content influence firm value. Abnormal returns are higher when there is supporting evidence in the content. Conversely, presence of brand innovation in the content negatively affect the abnormal returns associated with new product leakages. These findings offer novel insights into new product leakages and announcements for researchers and managers alike.
