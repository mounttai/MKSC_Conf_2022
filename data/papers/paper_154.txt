2 - Heterogeneous Position Effects and the Power of Rankings Rafael P. Greminger, Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands Most online search intermediaries and online retailers present products on product lists. By changing the ordering of products on these lists (the ranking), these online outlets can increase revenues at a potential cost to consumer welfare. This paper shows that rankings increase revenues through the differential impact of higher list positions on purchases of heterogeneous products, and provides empirical evidence for heterogeneity in these position effects. To quantify consumer welfare effects, I develop an estimation procedure for the search and discovery model of Greminger (2021). Counterfactual simulations highlight that - because of the complementarity in attributes and the position on the list - revenue-based rankings reduce consumer welfare only to a limited extent.
