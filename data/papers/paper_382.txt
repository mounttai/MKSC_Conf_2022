1 - Online Managerial Response Strategies Toward Customer Reviews: The Elaboration Likelihood Model, Emotion Contagion and Emotional Regulation Perspectives Hsiu-Yu Hung, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan Previous research has focused on exploring whether and how managerial responses (MRs) influence subsequent customer reviews (CRs) but there is no theoretically comprehensive framework for the interdependent relationships between MRs and previous/later CRs, or the dynamic influences of MRs on future CRs. To address this issue, this research integrates the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) with emotional contagion and regulation theories to depict the bilateral communication between firms and previous/subsequent customers in online settings. The author proposes a central route and two peripheral routes to depict the persuasion effects between previous and subsequent consumers’ CRs. The central route describes how previous customers’ numeric rating scores influence later customers’ rating scores through the mediator of cognitive process. The peripheral routes describe how previous customers’ positive/negative emotions will influence later customers’ positive/negative emotions; these can be moderated by eight MR strategic tools designed to regulate positive and negative emotions. The author collects text from customers’ reviews and managers’ responses on TripAdvisor using text-mining techniques to transform unstructured text data into focal variables, and analyze their temporally interdependent effects using VAR modeling. The author then examines the specific mediating effects on one central and two peripheral routes, as well as the different moderating effects of MR strategies on the regulation of customers’ emotional contagions. The empirical results support the proposed research propositions and hypotheses. Empirical  findings not only enrich the theoretical underpinnings for CR/ MR literature but also provide clearer understanding of the online bilateral communication mechanisms between firm and customers and managerial guidance for how customers’ emotional contagions might be regulated.
