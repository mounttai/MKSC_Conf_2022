2 - How do Variety-seeking Consumers Respond to Product Assortment Changes: Evidence from Vending Machines Yi Zhang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Andrew Ching, Jia Liu, Kohei Kawaguchi In the retail industry, it is believed that introducing new products and replacing existing products is essential for keeping the product lineup updated and attractive. Using a novel data set of vending machines purchases in Japan railway stations and a synthetic diff-in-diff framework, this paper studies how consumers with different variety-seeking tendency respond to such product assortment changes. We find that introducing new products increases the sales for a vending machine by attracting new consumers. Moreover, new products do not cannibalize the sales of existing products. We also show that, although removing consumersâ€™ favorite products reduces the sales in the vending machine, keeping diverse product assortments within-and-between vending machines prevents drops in sales due to within- and between-vending machine substitution from consumers. We also find that low variety-seeking consumers are more likely to substitute between vending machines due to the search of their favorite products, while high variety-seeking consumers tend to stay within the vending machine for other products.
