1 - Emotional Variability and Consumer Engagement: The Case of a Large Live Streaming Platform Chongyan Sun, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Francisco Cisternas Online streaming is the newest and fastest growing media over the last decade. Large platforms companies such as Meta (Facebook), YouTube, Twitch and Periscope have dedicated infrastructure for online streaming and it has allowed the growth of what has become a multi-billion dollar industry. In this industry, increasing consumer engagement is the top priority to achieve financial growth. Previous literature analyzed the influence of emotional reactions of streamers and viewers on volume of comments and tips. They found that status seeking and reciprocity were the main drivers of comments and tips, but those attributes do not vary  overtime, which is not reflected on the temporal distribution of comments and tips, where their volatilities tend to cluster together, causing strong fluctuation of engagement levels along timelines. To provide deeper understanding on this phenomenon, we have estimated a multivariate general autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (MGARCH) model at levels of various time periods with a number of sessions from a large Chinese live streaming platform to illustrate that consumer engagement level and emotion valence present strong volatility clustering themselves even after controlling the influence of the streamers, and more importantly, more volatile viewers’ emotion is associated with a higher level of their engagement, operationalized by the comment volumes. These results suggest that online platforms should carefully manage the volatility of viewers’ emotion other than its mean levels to promote more consumer engagement.
