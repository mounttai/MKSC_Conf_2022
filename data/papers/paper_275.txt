2 - Measuring Fair Competition on Digital Platforms Lukas Jürgensmeier, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany Bernd Skiera On digital platforms, platform actors such as sellers and buyers exchange goods, services, and information (offers). Platform providers support these exchanges by recommending specific offers on the platforms through rankings and labels. Often, however, the platform provider also serves as a platform actor. This dual role creates a potential conflict of interest: the platform provider could discriminate against third-party platform actors by recommending its offers more favorably than those from other platform actors. This presentation describes a novel approach to detect such discriminatory recommendations and applies it to the search engine on the Amazon Marketplace. Despite popular belief, our two studies covering more than a million daily observations from three countries hardly find discriminatory rankings through Amazon’s search engine. Though best-selling products with Amazon holding the buy box are more visible than other sellers’ buy box products, fair factors such as prices and ratings justify it. Furthermore,  Amazon Basics products are only half as visible organically as non-discriminatory rankings allowed. The presented approach enables platform actors, regulators, and lawmakers to test for discrimination on platforms. Applying this approach to the Amazon Marketplace challenges the notion that Amazon uses organic search results to discriminate against third parties.
