2 - Price Sensitivity and Retail Customer Analytics Sri Devi Duvvuri, Quantitative Research Consultant, SD Associates, Kenmore, WA In this research, we propose a method to classify customers on a price sensitivity continuum when the basket of goods is mixed--substitutes/complements/both. To identify a price sensitivity continuum, we calibrate a Bayesian multi-level factor analytic model using scanner panel data. To classify the customers further, we employ multivariate analyses (e.g., clustering) and validate the classification with survey data. Interestingly, the scanner panel data and survey data are derived from the same panel of customers provided by a  stand-alone retailer for garden products. We use hierarchical Bayesian inference tools (e.g. MCMC) to estimate the model parameters. Preliminary results indicate two price sensitivity clusters. We are in the process of generating retailer metrics using the model results in tandem with survey data.
