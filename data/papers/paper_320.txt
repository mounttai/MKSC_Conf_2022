3 - Rational Inattention and Brand Choice Ram C Rao, University of Texas- Dallas, Richardson, TX The Multinomial Logit Model has been a workhorse in empirical studies in marketing. It has been used extensively in modeling brand choice. Recent work has offered Rational Inattention as a foundational basis for the logit model. That is largely a theoretical exploration. Several questions arise for the marketeer. First, is there any advantage to using the RI approach as opposed to the conventional approach of maximizing consumerâ€™s random utility? If indeed there is an advantage, would the resulting empirical model differ from the logit model? And if so, in what ways? Would it present new econometric challenges? Since the RI approach essentially results in stochastic choice, how is that related to the stochastic models of consumer behavior developed by marketing researchers? Answering these questions leads to several findings in this paper. On the theoretical front the precise conditions are identified that result in a limiting case of the RI model to be identical to the Bass model of stochastic preference. Also identified are the conditions that make the empirical counterpart of the RI model equivalent to the logit model. However it is readily seen that these conditions are unlikely to hold in practice, thus making the RI approach an alternative to the logit model. The RI approach is shown to have the advantage of being able to separate the effects of price, for example, that affects consumption utility from the effects of an advertisement that affects information endowment of the consumer. This parceling out of marketing mix variables is generally not possible in the logit model. However, the implementation of the RI based model can pose significant identification challenges and therefore it could well be that the MNL is adequate for most practical situations.
