2 - Behavior-Based Pricing under Nontransparent Pricing Xi Li, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China Firms frequently collect consumers’ purchase history data for behavior-based pricing (BBP), the business practice of offering personalized prices to each of their consumers according to their purchase histories. Extant literature has studied BBP under the assumption that prices are transparent, i.e., the price that a firm offers to a consumer is observed by other firms and consumers. In practice, firms often offer each consumer an individualized price (e.g., through personalized mobile coupons) without it being observed by other firms or consumers. In this paper, we study the effect of BBP when prices are non-transparent to market participants other than the offering firm and the receiving consumer. We find that, when prices are non-transparent, BBP intensifies price competition in both periods, thereby eroding firm profits significantly. This finding suggests that BBP’s intensification of price competition may be more pronounced than previously known. Comparing the cases in which prices are transparent and non-transparent, we find that price transparency  improves firm profits but hurts consumer surplus. This result cautions public policymakers that practices that improve price transparency (e.g., data exchange between firms) can ultimately backfire on consumers.
