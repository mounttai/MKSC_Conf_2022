1 - Rising Retail Concentration: Superstar Firms and Household Demand Justin Leung, National University of Singapore, Singapore Zhonglin Li This paper investigates market concentration in the US retail sector. We use store- and household-level consumption micro-data from 2004-2019 to document four facts linked by a decomposition: 1) rising national concentration, 2) negligible change in regional concentration, 3) rising household concentration and heterogeneity across households, and 4) increased one-stop shopping. On the supply side, we find that increasing local availability of superstar retailers, rises in product variety, and changes in pricing explain a portion of these trends. On the demand side, we find that increases in  householdsâ€™ opportunity cost of time are also key drivers. We develop a model that can rationalize these results to highlight the implications for market power and welfare.
