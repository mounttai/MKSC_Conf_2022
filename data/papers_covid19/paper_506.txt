2 - Enhancing Customer Facing Business Recovery: Via the Choice of COVID-19 Transmission Reduction Measures Richard Carson, Professor, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA Kevin Clark, Jordan Louviere, Sam Mayfield We examine how the set of COVID-19 transmission reduction measures adopted influences the number of planned visits to 12 categories of businesses from three broad groups, personal services, restaurants and bars, and retail. The measures examined involve requiring face masks, vaccinating employees, requiring customers to be vaccinated, capacity  limits, third-party health/safety certification, visible cleanliness measures, and reduced contact service. The study uses a volumetric choice approach implemented using four large survey waves of Washington State residents which allow examination of the influence of these measures change over time. The statistical model fit to the data is a random effects negative binomial count data model. In addition to the set of COVID-19 transmission reduction measures, including status quo none, deployed, and a randomly-assigned price level change, the predictor variables include the individual’s self-report similar pre-COVID visits, and the respondent’s vaccination status and a set of demographic variables. The uniformly strongest positive effect across all 12 business categories we consider ranging from big national retailers to hair salons was for requiring face masks of all. Comparison to a price level change provides a common metric by which to judge effect sizes. Older people, women, and the vaccinated are less likely to make planned trips relative to previous behavior suggesting greater risk aversion and the key target for restoring past-levels of economic activity. The temporal patterns suggest stable preferences, controlling for the upwardly trending vaccination status. Wave 4 (first half of December) predict a sharp drop in planned trips, subsequently observed and in contrast to the steady increases seen in previous waves.
