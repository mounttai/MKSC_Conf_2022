3 - Visual Luxury Appeals: The Role of Extended- self and Hedonism for Social Media Engagement Yuqiao (Yuqi) Liang, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Jun Bum Kwon, Zhenyu Wang, Yichen Liu, Ka Wing Chan, Felix Septianto Since the pandemic outbreak, the online demand for luxury products has been growing sharply, despite their high price. In response, luxury companies invest more in their social media marketing to attract consumers. We investigate the effective dimensions of luxury appeals across different luxury product categories. By utilizing state-of-art AI service, we detect two personal luxury dimensions: extended-self and  hedonism from 65,000 images across 10 luxury fashion and 10 luxury hotel Instagram accounts. We find that an extended- self appeal is effective for luxury fashion, while a hedonism appeal is so for a luxury hotel. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications.
