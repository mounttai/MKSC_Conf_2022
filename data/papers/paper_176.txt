2 - The Role of Live in Livestreaming Markets: Evidence using Orthogonal Random Forest Ziwei Cong, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China Jia Liu, Puneet Manchanda A common belief about the growing medium of livestreaming is that its value lies in its live component. We study this belief by comparing how price elasticity of demand for live events varies before, on the day of, and after livestream. We take advantages of our unique access to rich datasets from a large livestreaming platform that allows consumers purchase the recorded version of livestream after the stream is over. Due to the presence of high-dimensional confounders whose relationships with treatment policy (i.e., price) and outcome of interests (i.e., demand) are complex and partially known in a panel data setting, we adopt a generalized Orthogonal Random Forest framework for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We find significant temporal dynamics in price elasticity of demand over the entire event life-cycle. Specifically, demand becomes less price sensitive over time to livestreaming day and is inelastic on that day. Over the post-livestream period, demand for recorded version is still sensitive to price, but is much less than pre-livestream period. We further provide evidence for the mechanisms driving our research findings: consumers value the opportunity of real-time interaction with content creators, and also consumers face with different levels of quality concerns over event life-cycle.
