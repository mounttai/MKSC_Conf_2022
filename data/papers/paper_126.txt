2 - Understanding Parent Opinions Using a Joint Pyramid Attention Network Wenchang Li, Sichuan University, Sichuan, China John P Lalor, Yixing Chen, Qiangming Yan In recent years, school rating platforms such as GreatSchools, NICHE, and U.S. News & World Report have become an important part of the landscape in facilitating parental choice when selecting schools. These platforms host a vast number of parent-generated school reviews, and such unstructured information is valuable for parents to make decisions and for schools to get feedback for their services. Therefore, mining parent opinions is crucial to supporting high-quality education services. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a text analysis task that extracts aspects from reviews and classifies the sentiment polarities attributed to each aspect, is closely related to extracting parent opinion towards various aspects of education services. However, the lack of gold-standard aspects and aspect-level annotations make building such an ABSA system difficult. In this paper, we propose a joint learning network for ABSA without aspect- level annotations. Our approach includes unsupervised aspect extraction and supervised sentiment classification trained simultaneously. For the sentiment classification task, we design a pyramid attention network (PAN) that uses easy-to-obtain review-level ratings as labels for training. At  the same time, PAN can capture sentiment at three levels: word-level, aspect-level, and review-level, for rich, detailed interpretability. Experiments on GreatSchools parent review datasets demonstrate that our approach can discover meaningful aspects from the reviews and shows a promising result on the review-level sentiment classification task.
