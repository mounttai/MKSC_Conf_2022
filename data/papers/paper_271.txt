1 - Digital Content and Customer Subscription Behavior  Daniel Guhl, Humboldt University Berlin, Berlin, Germany Pradeep Chintagunta, Michaela Draganska Many companies have now emerged publishing digital content, and they often rely on subscriptions to generate revenues. Because creating quality content is costly, the question arises of how much and what kind of content is needed to attract paying customers. Using data from an online adult entertainment platform, which produces and distributes video content organized in channels by genre, we construct three measures reflecting different aspects of the content available on a channel: amount, quality, and congruence (a measure that captures the similarity of videos within a channel). Unlike the mainstream movie industry, the release of videos on adult entertainment platforms is not driven by strategic considerations but rather a function of - somewhat unpredictable - factors driving production. We are thus able to build a model relating the impact of video content on the likelihood that a registered user of the site will convert to a paid subscription. Specifically, we formulate an individual-level subscription-timing model, where each registered user faces the competing risk of subscribing to a channel (or not) each week. We find that all three content measures affect subscription behavior positively. While this is expected for the amount and quality of content, the effect of congruence is new and seems to be dominant. These results are important for managers as well, as curating congruent content presumably costs less than producing more or higher-quality content.
