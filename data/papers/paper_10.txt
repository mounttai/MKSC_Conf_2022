1 - Influencer Racial Pay Gap Amy Pei, Northeastern University, Boston, MA Yakov Bart, Koen Pauwels, Kwong Chan Using a rich data set from a US influencer marketing platform, we find that campaign-based payment received by Black influencers can be substantially higher than the payment received by White influencers. We test several alternative reasons for this finding and show that the racial gap is most pronounced for macro-influencers. We demonstrate how the effect can be explained by the combination of increased demand from brands to create more diverse campaigns while reaching large audiences and the disproportionally high number of White (vs. Black) macro-influencers. We discuss the resulting managerial and public policy implications.
