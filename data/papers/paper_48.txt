2 - Pride and Prejudice in Online Reviews Leif Brandes, University of Lucerne, Luzern, 6005, Switzerland, leif.brandes@unilu.ch Online reviews for hotels are among the most frequently read types of online reviews. A common feature of hotels is that they bring together travelers with different nationalities and from different cultural backgrounds. Such cultural differences may give rise to misunderstandings and stereotypes. In this paper, we use a large sample of hotel bookings and online reviews and investigate to what extent such stereotypes exist in real online reviews. Based on research in social psychology and politics, we first define national stereotypes as statements that represent generalizations - both positive and negative - of individuals’ attitudes and behavior, based on these individuals’ nationality alone. Using a training sample of 1,500 annotated review sentences, we then use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to classify an additional sample of 10,000 sentences which contain the mentioning of a nationality. These findings revealed that around 25% of these sentences included at least one national stereotype. Motivated by this result, we then investigate the antecedents and consequences of such national stereotypes in online reviews.
