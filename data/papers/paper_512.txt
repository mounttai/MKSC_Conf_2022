2 - Estimating Worker Complementarity in Teams: Evidence from Real Estate Sales Teams Yan Xu, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA Andrew Ching, Junhong Chu Mantian Hu This paper studies complementarity between heterogeneous sales agents when they work in teams. Using the sales records of a leading real estate company in China, we find evidence on heterogeneous levels of complementarity between different types of agents. We implement a finite mixture approach and specify a non-linear model of teamwork. Our model identification relies on being able to observe one agent works in different teams. We estimate agent complementarity and team production without imposing additional functional form restrictions. With our model estimates, we seek to evaluate different team formation algorithmsâ€™ impacts on the overall team performances.
