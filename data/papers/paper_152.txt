4 - The Heterogeneous Effects of Social Media Content on Racial Attitudes Lena Song, NYU, New York, NY Social media content has the potential to either bring people together or push them apart. I formalize a model that predicts an inverted-U relationship between the content’s persuasiveness and its distance from the reader’s existing beliefs. Using online survey experiments, I expose U.S. adults with varying racial beliefs to social media content supporting racial justice. Racial moderates are persuaded and become more progressive after the exposure to moderately progressive content. The same content has little effect on racial progressives and conservatives, and extremely progressive content generates a backlash for racial conservatives. Racial conservatives and moderates rate more progressive content as less informative, less reliable and more objectionable. These findings provide causal evidence that racial justice content can be persuasive and highlight the importance of tailoring content in persuasion.
