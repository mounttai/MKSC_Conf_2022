1 - Machine Learning and Prediction Errors in Causal Inference Daniel Chen, The Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA Gad Allon, Zhenling Jiang, Dennis Zhang Machine learning is a growing method for causal inference. In machine learning settings, prediction errors are a commonly overlooked problem that can bias results and lead to arbitrarily incorrect parameter estimates. We consider a two- stage model where (1) machine learning is used to predict variables of interest, and (2) these predictions are used in a regression model for causal inference. Even when the model specification is otherwise correct, traditional metrics such as p-values and first-stage model accuracy are not good signals of correct second-stage estimates when prediction error exists. We show that these problems are substantial and persist across simulations and an empirical dataset. We propose general sample-based methods to identify when prediction errors are significantly biasing estimates and provide consistent corrections for the case where unbiased training data is available for the machine learning dataset.
