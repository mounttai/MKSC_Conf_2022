3 - Consumer Word-of-Mouth and Social Hierarchies: How Recipient Rank Influences Message Valence Chris du Plessis, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Singapore David Dubois This research investigates how recipient rank—whether a word-of-mouth (WOM) recipient is ranked lower, equal to, or higher than the WOM sender—influences WOM valence. We propose that WOM senders are less motivated to affiliate with lower-rank (vs. higher- or equal-rank) WOM recipients and thus share less positive information with these recipients. We tested the recipient rank effect in diverse WOM contexts, including real interactions with economic consequences. Seven experiments (n = 3,666) show that the recipient rank effect is (a) mediated by the affiliation motivation, (b) is attenuated among WOM senders with low self-monitoring motivation, which reflects low sensitivity to affiliation cues, and (c) disappears when the recipient is explicitly an in-group (vs. out-group) member. We rule out  four alternative explanations: differential product selection, perceived responsibility, role expectations, and reputational concern. Finally, we test a simple intervention for marketers: the negative effect of recipient rank on WOM valence disappears when WOM senders are encouraged to bond with the WOM recipient. Taken together, this work sheds new light on the impact of audience characteristics on WOM valence, elucidates why, how, and when recipient rank influences WOM valence, and offers actionable implications for managers for recruiting WOM advocates.
