18- The In-Store Experience Induces Price Primacy Amongst Online Shoppers Nicolette Sullivan, The London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom Ling-Ling Zhou, Gavan Fitzsimons  Physical stores often offer a website or app as an alternative, and we know little about how information search differs - especially if these experiences occur in sequence or simultaneously. However, changes to information search, such as the order of information acquisition or time dwelt on specific attributes, have a large influence on choice. Here, participants shopped for haptic products such as carpets, and experienced an online or in-store experience first, or both simultaneously. The online experience allowed participants to view product information by hovering over attribute (e.g., price) with a mouse cursor. The in-store experience allowed participants to touch and hold the products and view the price. Participants then ranked the products and were told, without deception, that one participant would receive their highest-ranked option installed in their home. We found that participants viewed price first and for longer when the in-store experience came first, and induced more transitions from price to brand information, and fewer transitions between haptic or quality information such as ratings and material, compared to performing the online experience first. By contrast, when able to view online information while holding the products, participants viewed price less. A condition in which only online information was available induced more gaze to quality information such as reviews. Together, this indicates that the order in which each shopping context is experienced alters the order of information acquisition.
