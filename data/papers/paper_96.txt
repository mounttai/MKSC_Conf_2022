3 - Corporate Social Responsibility and its Spillover Effects in Consumers’ Behavior Rita Coelho do Vale, Associate Professor, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa, Católica Lisbon School of Business and Economics, Lisboa, Portugal Pedro Verga Matos, Filipa de Almeida This article analyzes the impact of corporate social responsibility initiatives on the potential spillover effect on consumers’ adoption of similar responsible behaviors. Several prior studies have reported that there is a considerable gap between consumers’ apparent interest in CSR and the limited role of CSR in consumers’ behavior (Aguinis and Glavas, 2012; Oberseder et al., 2011), with the link between exposition to a certain social behavior and its further adoption being very blurred (Dolan and Galizi, 2015; Lanzini and Thogersen, 2014; Truelove et al., 2014). We study then this potential spillover effect, analyzing to what extent consumers’ exposure to CSR practices boosts their own tendency to engage in similar pro- sustainable and responsible behaviors. Data was collected through a longitudinal study using an online data panel, across 7 moments in time, engaging 400 participants, leading to 2511 observations, assessing the impact of different CSR initiatives (social, environmental and philanthropic) on multiple variables (e.g., action evaluation, behavioral intention, consumer engagement), across several industries  (e.g., FMCG, fashion, household retailing).Preliminary findings indicate that not all types of CRS initiatives lead to similar types of behavioral intentions and behavioral engagement. Interestingly, results suggest that although CSR initiatives in the social domain lead to higher behavioral intentions, these are not translated to actual behavioral engagement on social activities. Instead, environmental CSR actions are the ones revealing higher spillover effect, across multiple domains. These results offer insights to both regulators, public authorities, and managers, about CSR practices that are likely to generate higher environmental & social impact.
