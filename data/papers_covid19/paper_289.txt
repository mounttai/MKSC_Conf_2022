3 - Designing Social Robots as Human Companions: Does One Size Fit All? Iqbal U Ahmed, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA Dipankar Chakravarti Loneliness and social exclusion are major contemporary social problems (Cacioppo and Patrick 2008) and reflect a gap between an individual’s desired nature and quality of social connections and the relationships actually in place. A rich literature addresses the serious physical/mental health impacts of loneliness, as well as prevention and coping interventions. Research in social robotics is bringing us closer to reality in which we partner with physically embodied agents with autonomy and interaction capability (Henschel, et al., 2020). In the consumer domain, Mourey et al. (2017) find that engaging with anthropomorphic products may mitigate social exclusion effects. Plausibly, human-robot interactions may also help mitigate loneliness through interactions with social  robots with aligned personalities.Such personality alignments pose a key design challenge since not all consumers may wish to interact with social robots in the same way when lonely. For some, loneliness stems from social exclusion, whereas others may actually prefer to limit social contact (i.e., social excluders). The companionship preferences of social excluder and socially excluded consumers may differ. Thus, the former may prefer interactions that are largely cognitive- deliberative and resist emotional investment.We develop and test a set of measurement instruments to distinguish social excluders and socially excluded consumers. We find that although social excluders mirror some opponent traits to those socially excluded, they also feature other traits that differ on unrelated dimensions. We compare our instruments to other inventories (e.g., Myer-Briggs) and discuss their use in designing social robots that more effectively match the user’s companionship preferences and service needs.
