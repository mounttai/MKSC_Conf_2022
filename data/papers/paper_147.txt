2 - Firm Responses to the Content and Emotions Expressed in Social-Media Word of Mouth Aishwarrya Deore, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI This study examines the influence of content and emotional feedback expressed through social-media channels on 1) firm revenues and consumer purchasing decisions, 2) firm quality outcomes, and 3) firm operational and resource allocations. Using psychology theory as a framework and textual analyses methods, I classify web scrapings of millions of social media posts for 19 US airlines for the 2007-2019 period based on its cognitive content and emotional type. I identify social media word-of-mouth (SWOM) feedback about five quality- related themes based on their emotional type. The results show that negative and non-negative quality-related SWOM impact consumer and firm outcomes. Firm revenues and consumer volume decrease (increase) following negative (non-negative) quality-related SWOM. Firms improve quality outcomes following negative quality-related SWOM. Firms also alter the level of operations, change pricing strategies, and enhance quality-cost investments following quality- related emotional SWOM. This research highlights the usefulness of SWOM as a source of customer feedback for firms and its decision-facilitating role and provides evidence that firms incorporate both the content and emotional type of customer feedback in their management control design. It also contributes to the marketing literature on the socio- economic impact of SWOM on consumers and firms alike and sheds light on product design choices that change in response to SWOM.
