3 - Expert Opinions and Consumer Reviews: Evidence from the Michelin Guide Yiting Deng, University College London, London, United Kingdom Xingyi Li, Puneet Manchanda, Bert De ReycK The consumer purchase journey is influenced by both expert opinions and consumer reviews. However, it is not clear whether favorable expert opinions improve or hurt consumers’ quality evaluations. This paper explores the effect of expert opinions on consumer reviews in the context  of Michelin stars in the restaurant industry. We constructed a unique data set based on the Michelin Guide for Great Britain & Ireland from 2010 to 2020. For each restaurant that was awarded Michelin stars during these 11 years, we collected online consumer reviews from TripAdvisor and retrieved relevant historical menus. Based on the data, we first estimate the effect of Michelin star changes on the sentiment and content of consumer reviews. We find that when a restaurant is removed from the Michelin Guide or lose stars, consumers’ review ratings increase, and consumers become less demanding regarding service and value for money. Next, we analyze restaurant menu, and find that restaurants tend to modify menu structure and adapt menu price in response to the Michelin star awards. We discuss managerial implications for restaurants and the Michelin Guide.
