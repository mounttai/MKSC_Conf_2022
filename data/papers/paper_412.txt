2 - Can Emergency Care Advertising Benefit Patients? Tae Jung Yoon, KAIST College of Business, Seoul, Korea, Republic of Simon Kim, Ti Tongil Kim U.S. hospitals have substantially increased spending on advertising in recent years, with a substantial portion of it focused on emergency care. This is in contrast with a common belief that advertising may not be effective for patients choosing a hospital in the midst of medical emergency, and little studies have examined the impact of such advertising. Using individual patient hospital discharge data and hospital television advertising data from Florida, we investigate how hospital advertising affects emergency department (ED) patients’ choice of hospitals and subsequent health outcomes. We find that ED patients’ travel distance to hospital increases when they are exposed to a higher level of hospital advertising focused on emergency care. We also observe substantial heterogeneous responses in terms of patient characteristics and location-specific factors. We further discuss subsequent implications in patient health outcomes to determine whether emergency care advertising can ultimately benefit patients.
