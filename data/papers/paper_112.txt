1 - Modeling Demand for Independent Product Video Reviews Maciej Szymanowski, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands Gabor Murai Product reviews produced by content creators are popular on social media and constitute an important source of brand information for consumers. Understanding consumption of such content is, therefore, important for marketing scholars and practitioners interested in how consumers learn about brands. In this paper we study two fundamental issues about demand for the content creator generated reviews, 1) whether the demand is driven by the product being reviewed, and by the content creator, 2) are reviews from different content creators of the same products substitutes or complements. Using longitudinal data on video reviews of personal smart devices posted on YouTube, we provide the first evidence about demand for earned media. We find that both product and content creator are significant drivers of demand for content creator generated reviews. We also find that videos about the same product, published by different creators, benefit one anotherâ€™s viewership in the short run, presumably by attracting attention to the product featured. However, in the long run, views captured by one review have a negative association with the number of subsequent views of competing reviews. We discuss the findings and draw conclusions for managers.
