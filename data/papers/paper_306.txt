2 - The Impact of Co-location of Departments on Joint Sales in Retail Stores Laxminarayana Yashaswy Akella, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad, India Praveen K Kopalle, Dhruv Grewal, Jens Nordfält Retail stores have finite space in which they decide the arrangements of departments. Relying on store layouts and sales data from a retailer across ten stores, this research presents the importance of considering co-location on joint sales. Certain vital factors such as location, the total area of the departments and the store, type of departments (substitutes, complementary, and neutral), and department layout have been considered for a micro understanding of the store. Results show that the co-location of two departments has an ‘inverted-U’ relationship with joint sales. This paper finds that in the type of departments, the complementary departments need not be arranged just beside each other but away so that the departments in the store overall appear complementary. In contrast, substitutes of a department have to be placed at the exact location and cannot be dispersed through the store. This would allow customers to compare the products with their peers without moving much. For neutral departments (i.e., where the departments are unrelated), they can be placed at sufficient distances to each other to avoid distraction with the basket items. In additional insight, this paper finds that implementing different layouts for different departments significantly improve sales over having the same format for each department (the layouts of the individual departments must differ from each other).
