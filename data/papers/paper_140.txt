3 - Do Women Pay More than Men for Indirect Auto Financing? Cem Ozturk, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC Cheng He, Pradeep Chintagunta We study whether, and if so, when women pay more than men for auto loans, the third most prevalent consumer debt category in the U.S. In theory, the availability of many lenders in the auto loan market could hinder markup discrimination between genders. However, consumer advocates have long maintained that the lack of transparency in dealer markups for indirect auto loans incentivizes dealers to charge what they think they can get away with, rather than what consumers are eligible for, based on their credit tiers. We show that dealers charge higher markups to women than men using detailed individual transaction-level data. We also find that the difference in dealer markups between female and male buyers is smaller for 1) women in census tracts with higher education levels, 2) younger women, and 3) women who trade in a car. The gender gap in dealer markups disappears in dealers in Democratic (vs. Republican) counties and for loans from captive lenders (i.e., financing arms of automakers). It diminishes as the number of financial institutions in the dealersâ€™ markets increases. It even reverses for the youngest group of women. These findings inform policymakers and consumers about the extent of the previously undocumented gender gap in indirect auto financing and situations more susceptible to unfair lending to women.
