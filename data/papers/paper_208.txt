1 - An Analysis of Dollar Store Entry on Local Market Structure El Hadi Caoui, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Brett Hollenbeck, Matthew Osborne This paper studies the expansion of dollar store chains in the U.S. retail landscape following the Great Recession (2008- 2019). This expansion has been accompanied by growing public concern over the impact on other retailers and food accessibility in local communities. We develop an empirical framework to evaluate the impact of entry regulation on spatial market structure and consumersâ€™ shopping behavior. A dynamic game of entry, exit and investment into spatially differentiated locations is specified, allowing for chain- level economies of density. Reduced-form evidence and counterfactual simulations indicate that dollar store chains compete strongly with the grocery and convenience segments and are associated with lower access to fresh produce.
