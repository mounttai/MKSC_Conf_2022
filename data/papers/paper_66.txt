4 - Targeting Prospective Influencers on User- Generated Content Platforms Daniel Shapira, Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel Andreas Lanz, Jacob Goldenberg, Florian Stahl Given the ubiquity of user-generated content platforms, endorsements by influencers have become an integral part of online communications. But excessive monetary compensations and existing contractual agreements of influencers limit the ability of many firms to engage in effective influencer seeding. We suggest a different approach, which is forward-looking: A manager can target prospective influencers—while they are still largely unknown (e.g., a few months after sign-up)—and sign them to endorse the firm in the far future (e.g., dozens of months after sign-up). This approach has the potential to significantly reduce costs. However, because of the inherent and extreme financial uncertainty (as only rarely do new sign-ups ultimately become influencers), we propose a novel framework to cope with this rare-event problem. The idea is to build on expected utility theory using a dynamic Bellman-like formalism to account for three managerial trade-offs: the present-future, risk- return, and gain- loss trade-offs. For empirical demonstration and application, we conduct data-based simulations using a dataset from SoundCloud in which we apply various prediction models (e.g., deep learning, extreme gradient boosting, logistic regression, and rare-event models by Firth (1993) as well as King and Zeng (2001a,b)).
