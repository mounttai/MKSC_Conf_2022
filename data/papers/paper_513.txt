3 - Peer Effects from Friends and Strangers: Evidence from Random Matchmaking in an Online Game Daniel Goetz, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Wei Lu In this paper, we quantify the relative strength of social interaction (peer) effects from friends versus peer effects from strangers on consumers’ product adoption decisions. We use a rich panel of data on in-app purchases and match play histories from an online game, where we leverage the game’s quasi-random assignment of teammates and opponents to identify the causal effect of observed adoptions on purchasing. We find that adoptions by friends and strangers on the same team as the focal player have positive effects on focal consumers’ adoptions; that the marginal peer effect from friends is nearly twice as large as the effect from  strangers; and that the cumulative peer effect from strangers is almost as large as the effect from friends given the higher volume of interactions with strangers. The evidence supports that peer effects operate by increasing awareness of the product. We discuss the managerial implications for optimal product seeding and team formation in this context.
