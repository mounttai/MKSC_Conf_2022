2 - TV Advertising and Media Multitasking  Zachary Nolan, University of Delaware, Wilmington, DE Matthew McGranaghan We analyze media multitasking---simultaneous engagement with multiple media sources---by combining TV set-top box data with novel internet usage data. The internet usage data contain the exact timing and device used to visit specific content providers and websites, giving us a comprehensive record of household media viewing habits. Incorporating TV ad schedules, we document a significant increase in internet activity following the start of TV ad breaks, with heterogeneity in the effect across households. We document the degree of multitasking as a function of ad content, programming content, device type, time of day, and household demographics. The variation in second screen usage is consistent with documented ad-avoidance and information-seeking behaviors.
