1 - Modeling Demand for Durables with Financing Option in Configurators Tetyana Kosyakova, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany Thomas Otter, Arash Laghaie Product configurators find application in many different industries, and companies are increasingly engaging in mass customization and offering consumers a menu of various features and options for configuring their own products and services. However, modeling demand for configured products is challenging for a number of reasons: i) the number of possible configurations (the size of the implied choice set) is large, ii) the typical configurator combines multinomial choices (e.g., the choice of a car engine) with menu choices (e.g., various optional features that in principle can be freely combined), iii) the possible configuration results span enormous price ranges (e.g., when configuring a car), and iv) configurators for high ticket items often include financing options. The resulting choice surface is both extremely high-dimensional and highly structured. We extend the model proposed in Kosyakova et al. (2020) to meet these challenges. We construct an exchange-algorithm that handles high-dimensional combinations of multinomial and menu choices that determine the final configuration (choice). In the underlying economic model of choice, we allow for two sets of liquidity constraints: one pertaining to the maximum  non-financed purchase price and one reflecting the maximum monthly payment from a financed purchase. We illustrate our model in a case study that uses configurators in a discrete choice experiment in the car category.
