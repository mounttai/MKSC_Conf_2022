4 - Roll-out of New Brands and the Role of Entry Costs  Tomomichi Amano, Harvard Business School, Boston, MA Manufacturers commonly adopt a roll-out process in introducing new products to retailers. In the market for consumer packaged goods, firms are often observed to roll-out new brands graduallyâ€”expanding out from markets that are closer in physical distance, or similar in attributes to previously entered markets, such as belonging to the same retail chain. Roll-out within a retailer is not always uniform. We establish that entry costs are smaller for markets that are similar to ones in which the brand has already entered. These costs can be heterogeneous within a retailer. We illustrate that these costs can be consequential in dictating the path by which new products diffuse.
