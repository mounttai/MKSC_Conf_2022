1 - The Role of Syntactic Entropy in the Effectiveness of Marketing Messages Siham El Kihal, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management gGmbH, Frankfurt, Germany  A.Selin Atalay, Florian Ellsaesser Language plays a key role in the effectiveness of marketing messages. Reaching a desired outcome requires arranging words to formulate a message (i.e., syntax). This task is not trivial. The authors study the role of syntax in marketing communications by focusing on syntactic entropy. Syntactic entropy refers to the average surprisal in the syntax of a message. A metric that captures syntactic entropy is introduced. The role of syntactic entropy in the effectiveness of marketing messages is tested using the syntactic entropy metric. In a series of studies including field data and randomized field experiments from contexts such as product descriptions, advertising, and product reviews, the authors show that the syntactic entropy of a message is related to its effectiveness. This relationship follows an inverted U-shape, such that medium syntactic entropy messages are most effective. The authors demonstrate how these findings can be used to write effective marketing messages. In two experiments conducted on Facebook, in collaboration with two independent companies, it is shown that all else being equal, ads written with medium syntactic entropy result in higher click-through rates than ads written with low or high syntactic entropy.
