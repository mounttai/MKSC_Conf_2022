2 - Gazing Right: Decoding the Effects of Eye Gaze Directions in Marketing Images with Deep Learning Eugene Pavlov, University of Miami, Miami, FL  Zhuping Liu, Shuai Yang, Chunmian Ge Human faces are often used in marketing images to promote products in online e-commerce. The real-world effects of face presence and gaze directions in such contexts, however, have not been studied in the literature. In this paper, we apply scalable deep learning methods to more than a quarter million images across 351 brands to detect face presence and gaze directions and then empirically test their effects on consumer responses. We find positive effects of face presence on consumer clicks but insignificant effects on purchases. However, we find substantial heterogeneity across different gaze directions where right gaze is the only effective direction to drive both more clicks and more purchases. Direct gaze and the other averted gazes increase clicks, but they do not lead to more purchases. Hence, it is important to distinguish between different averted gazes and extend the conventional comparison solely between the averted gaze and the direct gaze. We have also replicated the strong positive effects of right gaze on click and purchase intentions in a controlled experiment and identified curiosity as a potential mediator. Overall, these results demonstrate how scalable deep learning can help extract relevant information from unstructured multimedia content for marketing purposes and that gazing right is critical.
