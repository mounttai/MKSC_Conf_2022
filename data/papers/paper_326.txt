2 - Advertising Content and Quantity Avery Haviv, Simon School of Business, Rochester, NY In a digital advertising context, firms are able to quickly make changes to their marketing plans, as ad auctions are performed shortly before delivery. However, most television advertising by large firms is pre-committed in the upfront market, which takes place in Spring. This market was worth 9 billion dollars in 2018. Pre-commitment might prevent firms from changing their advertising spending in response to the state of their rival, though they are still able to change their advertising content. I develop a dynamic structural model to investigate how firms advertising behavior changes when they are able to adjust their advertising spending on a monthly basis, in response to their rivals advertising spending, and brand equity. I study the effect of this pre-commitment problem in the duopolistic US consumer battery market.  Advertising effectiveness is identified by looking at how variation in category demand correlates with the relative demand of branded batteries.
