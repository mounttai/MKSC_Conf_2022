2 - Leveraging Consumer Complaints to Make Product Recall Decisions yujie Qu, Central South University, Changsha, China Wen Shi, Jia Liu This paper develops a methodological framework that can predict product recall probability and facilitate the creation of recall statements, based on past consumer complaints which have been acknowledged as the main trigger of product recalls in practice. The framework is built on a nonparametric Bayesian topic model, called Hierarchical Dual Pitman-Yor Process (HDPYP). HDPYP can extract defect topics and quantify the relative semantic importances of all complaints that are associated with the same recall statement. HDPYP can be empowered by any prediction model (e.g., logistic regression, survival model, and random forest), which can predict the probability of whether a product will be recalled from the market given all the complaints observed so far and the estimated importances from HDPYP. HDPYP can also estimate the extent to which each defect topic in consumer complaint is deemed summary worthy by the people who need to write the recall statement. We apply our proposed framework in automobile complaints and recall data sets from the U.S. automobile market. We show that our topic model can generate meaningful substantive insights. We also show that our topic model can provide a more meaningful way to aggregate all the information across consumer complaints so that prediction accuracy can be significantly improved under any prediction model.
