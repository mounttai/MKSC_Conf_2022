3 - Empirical Analysis of Cognitive Limitations in Consumer Decision Making Navdeep S Sahni, Stanford University, Stanford, CA Konstantin Korotkiy Typical consumer decisions involve comparing and choosing among multiple options, which requires consumers to spend limited cognitive resources. While cognitive limitations are important, it is hard to quantify their impact on consumer decisions and firm policies in natural settings: consumers may have unobserved idiosyncratic preferences and beliefs so it is hard for a researcher to ascertain consumer mistakes due to cognitive limitations. In this paper we use a novel dataset to overcome this difficulty and precisely identify consumer mistakes and use them to estimate the monetary equivalent cognitive costs at the individual level. We estimate  a structural choice model to shed light on the underlying connections between cognitive costs, income, price elasticity, discount hunting etc. We use our model to study how grocery chain pricing strategies affect profits and social welfare for different customer strata.
