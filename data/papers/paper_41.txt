1 - The Cost of Fairness in Personalized Policies Ayelet Israeli, Harvard Business School, Boston, MA Eva Ascarza Algorithmic personalization allows decision makers to design interventions at a high level of precision, which benefits both decision makes and consumers. For example, in the context of online advertising, personalization helps firms become more efficient in their resource allocation (e.g., serving ads to those consumers who are most likely to engage with the product) and helps consumers receive ads that are most relevant to them. However, algorithmic personalization also poses risks to society by disproportionately targeting individuals from certain groups (or protected attributes such as gender or race) - generally referred as group fairness -- or producing disparate outcomes for individuals who are identical except for their protected attributes - generally referred as individual fairness. Decision makers are increasingly concerned about potential unfairness of their algorithms and are encouraged to implement solutions that could potentially mitigate bias and unfair outcomes. However, adding fairness constraints to an algorithm would naturally reduce its efficiency, creating a tradeoff that is difficult for managers to assess: how much efficiency would be sacrificed to ensure more fair outcomes? In this paper we quantify this tradeoff by empirically measuring the cost (i.e., the loss in efficiency) of ensuring individual and group fairness. To do so, we analyze algorithmic predictions in real world data across multiple contexts, including credit card defaults, marketing messaging recommendations, and income predictions using Census data.‚Äù
