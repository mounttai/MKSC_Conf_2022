3 - The Role of Consumer Perceptions of the Ethics of Machine Learning in the Appropriation of Artificial Intelligence- based Systems Christine Balague, Institut Mines-Télécom Business School, EVRY, France Zeling Zhong Generally, we expect Machine Learning (ML) in marketing to provide efficient recommendation systems, improvement in advertising with real time bidding, more accurate customers’ behaviors predictions, and better CRM.
