2 - Optimal Advertising Policy to Maximize Conversion, Loyalty, and Revenue Saman Modiri, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY Liangbin Yang, Amiya K Basu To find the optimal advertising budget and strategy, companies need to define and reliably measure customer response. This is complicated because customer response can be multi-faceted, incorporating such different elements as conversion, purchase frequency, monetary value, and individual heterogeneity. Additionally, companies need to not only consider the short-term implications of their campaigns, but also the long-term ones. In this research, following insight from the stochastic models of buyer behavior, we develop a framework to define key performance indicators such as conversion, loyalty, and revenue at both individual and population levels. We connect these parameters to the firmsâ€™ advertising activities using a time-variant DID framework. Using this framework allows us to capture the short-term and long-term advertising effects while accounting for individual heterogeneity. Merging a consumer and retail panel with advertisement data, we analyze more than 1K instances of advertisement campaigns for 5 different brands over the span of 12 years. Our results have important implications for advertisers and equip them with a mechanism to better optimize their ad campaigns. Using counterfactual analysis and contrasting our model with benchmarks, we show that our model provides new insight into customer response. We discuss the heterogeneous effect of ad campaigns on different response metrics and show this heterogeneity to be robust and significant, thus highlighting the need to take into account multiple metrics when optimizing an ad campaign.
