7 - Don’t Need All Eggs in One Basket: Reconstructing Composite Embeddings of Customers From Individual-domain Embeddings Pan Li, New York University, New York, NY Moshe Unger, Shahana Sen, Alexander Tuzhilin Although building a 360-degree comprehensive view of a customer has been a long-standing goal in marketing, this challenge has not been successfully addressed in many marketing applications because fractured customer data  stored across different silos are hard to integrate under one roof due to platform-related technical problems and breaching of privacy norms around customer information. To this end, we propose a Deep Learning-based method, theoretically grounded in Kolmogorov’s Mapping Neural Network Existence Theorem, to integrate several product or domain-specific partial customer views into one consolidated or composite customer profile, where we need to securely access domain-specific or siloed customer data only once for building the initial customer embeddings. We conduct extensive studies on two industrial applications to demonstrate that our method effectively reconstructs stable composite customer embeddings that constitute strong approximations of the ground-truth composite embeddings obtained from integrating the siloed raw customer data. Moreover, we show that these privacy-preserving reconstructed composite embeddings significantly outperform partial embeddings while providing recommendations for new domains, and outperform state-of- the-art baselines in the consumer response prediction tasks.
