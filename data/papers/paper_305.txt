1 - Impact of ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ on Consumer Purchases Stijn Maesen, Imperial College Business School, London, United Kingdom Dionysius Ang ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ (BNPL) is a payment method that allows consumers to pay in instalments and has become popular among retailers and consumers. However, little is known  about the influence of BNPL on consumer purchases. This research provides insights on the impact of BNPL on consumer purchases by leveraging data on the introduction of BNPL as a payment method by a large U.S. retailer. The introduction of the BNPL payment method allowed consumers to purchase products immediately and pay with four equal repayments. We exploit that after the retailer made BNPL available to its customers, only a selection of customers adopted the service. To mitigate possible bias due to self-selection of BNPL adoption, we use matching on observable factors to increase the comparability of adopters and non-adopters of BNPL. The results of a difference- in-difference analysis show that adopters of BNPL spend significantly more than non-adopters in the period after the introduction of BNPL. We also explore heterogeneity in this effect between customers and across time, and further discuss the implications of our findings.
