2 - Dynamic Price Competition: Theory and Evidence from Airline Markets Aniko Oery, Yale School of Management, New Haven, CT , Ali Hortascu, Kevin Williams  We study dynamic pricing in a competitive setting where sellers are endowed with finite capacities and face uncertain demands toward a sales deadline. With perfect information, price dynamics are determined not only by changing own- sale opportunity costs and demand, but also by strategic incentives to soften future price competition. We study equilibrium properties and apply our framework to the airline industry using daily pricing and bookings data for competing airlines. We show that the use of pricing algorithms---similar to those implemented in practice---soften price competition but do not create additional dead-weight loss compared to the perfect information benchmark.
