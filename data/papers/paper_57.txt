3 - Co-creation in New Product Development: Collaborating with the Competitor in the Presence of a Shared Supplier Abhishek Roy, Temple University, Fox School of Business, Philadelphia, PA, , abhishek.roy@temple.edu The increasing complexity of technology has resulted in the emergence of a few key suppliers, and new product development has become a complex endeavor. Consequently, firms are increasingly involving their suppliers in co-creating new products and services through collaborative alliances. In many industries, such suppliers are shared by competing manufacturers. In such industries, competing manufacturers may benefit from forming alliances and co-creating new products jointly with their shared suppliers. Using a game theoretic model, we analyze the strategic interactions in such a collaborative alliance and examine the strategic trade-offs that arise when competing buyers decide to co-create a common component with the supplier, instead of relying on the supplier to independently develop the component. Our research highlights several interesting results. First, we show that in an industry where a few key suppliers are common to most buyers or manufacturers, such in the smartphone and electric vehicle industries, and the quality of the common component is critical to consumer demand, collaborative design processes improve the quality of the shared component produced by the common supplier. Furthermore, as consumers attach more value to the quality of the shared component, the quality of the component increases as more firms participate in the co-design process. Conversely, when consumers do not value the quality of the component highly enough, a collaborative endeavor to co-design the component may backfire. Additionally, whether the quality of the component will increase by involving more firms in co-design depends on other market conditions, such as the firmsâ€™ costs of exerting effort, and the direct and indirect price sensitivities of the consumers.
