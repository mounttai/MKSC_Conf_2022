2 - Advertising Content: The Role of Messengers Chi-Ying Wang, Yale School of Management, New Haven, CT , Jiwoong Shin We develop a model of communication messenger in advertising where advertising can generate a product- match related signal for consumers. We take a dual-mode of communication perspective for advertising communication. In our model, a messenger serves as a cue which is communicated through less costly peripheral route while the central issue-relevant information requires thoughtful consideration. We consider advertising as a problem of Bayesian Persuasion where communication messenger can determine the information structure the consumer will face, and a different type of communication messengers can affect such information structure. Our model provides a rich set of insights concerning the impact of different types of messengers on the incentives for consumers to deliberate the advertising message, and the firmâ€™s optimal choice of communication messenger and prices.
