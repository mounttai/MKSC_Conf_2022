2 - The Influence of Product Location Changes on Consumer In-store Consideration and Choice Ella J Xu, New York University, New York, NY Bryan K Bollinger, Raluca Ursu In this paper, we study the role of in-store product location changes on consumers’ decision-making processes. We study this question with a novel data set that combines product sales and household transaction data with in-store consumer eye-tracking data. We find that changes in product locations disrupt consumers’ habitual buying behavior. Consumers have a tendency to begin their search close to the previous location of products they purchased before, and their searches are less focused after these product locations change. This then leads consumers to consider products they have not previously purchased. After a previously purchased product moves, we find that consumers are more likely to purchase other products that are proximate to both the previous and new locations of their previously purchased products, especially those from brands they have not yet purchased. These findings have implications for retailers reorganizing their store and aisle layouts, and for manufacturers for whom consumers’ habitual buying processes provide barriers to new consumer acquisition and/ or increased brand and product loyalty.
