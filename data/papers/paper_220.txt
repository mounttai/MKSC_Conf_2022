2 - Rational Addiction in Mobile Consumption Jeeva Somasundaram, IE Business School, Madrid, Spain Laura Zimmermann, Duc Pham Quang Many consumers would like to reduce their smartphone usage but fail to do so due to the addictive nature of many smartphone applications. We build a theoretical model that examines the effects of myopic versus forward-looking habit formation as well as satiation models on consumption of a good. We empirically test our predictions by conducting two pre-registered randomized control trials that aim to reduce consumersâ€™ smartphone usage by providing temporary targets and monetary incentives over a period of time. When future targets and incentives are pre-announced, subjects conduct themselves in a forward-looking (rather than myopic) manner and reduce their mobile usage (rather than increase their consumption as predicted by satiation models) even before they are actually incentivized to do so. Subjects maintain a lower usage during the incentivized period and sustain a lower usage even after incentives are removed. Consistent with adjacent complementarity, we show that reduction in post-treatment usage is driven mainly by subjects who have lower usage during the treatment periods. However, we do not find any effect of reducing mobile usage on academic performance or well-being. Our manuscript thus provides empirical support for the theoretical framework of rational addiction in the domain of mobile usage by showing that pre-announcing future targets and incentives can be a cost-effective intervention to kick start behavioral change.
