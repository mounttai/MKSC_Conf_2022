4 - Second Screening While Watching TV: The Role of Different User Groups and Effects on Repeat Viewing  Renana Peres, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel Sarah Gelper, Mitchell Lovett TV viewers often use other devices such as their mobile or tablet while watching. Such second screening is of interest for practitioners to enhance engagement and increase viewership. This paper studies the determinants, usage, and effects of second screening, accounting for a broad set of influences such as online and offline communications and exposures to show promos. We use large-scale individual- level data from mobile diaries of 1,702 US TV viewers on 2,755 primetime TV shows over 3-6 weeks. The data are augmented with show airing, promo exposure, and individual-level people meter data. Second screening occurs in 16% of the viewing reports. 56% of the second screening is unrelated to the show, and 44% is show-related communication or information search. Latent class analysis identifies four viewer segments: heavy viewers, sports enthusiasts, sitcom viewers, and light viewers. The heavy viewer segment is more likely to do show-related second screening. Causal forest analysis shows that communicating about a show while viewing has a positive impact on the viewing intentions while unrelated second screening has a negative effect. However, this dual effect holds only for the heavy viewer segment and for infrequent viewers of the show, and only for viewing intentions, not actual viewing.
