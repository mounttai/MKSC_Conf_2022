2 - An Empirical Analysis of Optimal Nonlinear Pricing Soheil Ghili, Yale University, New Haven, CT In ``continuous choice’’ settings, consumers decide not only whether but also how much to purchase. As a result, firms should optimize a full price schedule rather than a single price point. This paper provides a methodology to empirically estimate the optimal schedule under multi-dimensional consumer heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that the optimal second-degree price discrimination (i.e., optimal nonlinear tariff) improves the firm’s profit upon linear pricing by about 10\%. That said, this second-degree price discrimination scheme only recovers 10\% of the gap between the profitability of linear pricing (i.e., no price discrimination) and that of infeasible first degree price discrimination. We also conduct further counterfactual analysis to shed more light on the effects of different parameters on the shape of the optimal nonlinear price schedule.
