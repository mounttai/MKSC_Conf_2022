1 - Dynamics of Spatial Proximity Effect and Consumer Online Shopping Behavior Meng Ji, Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN Jingcun Cao, Shyam Gopinath, Shibo Li Spatial proximity has been shown to play a significant role in consumers’ shopping behaviors in the marketing literature. However, existing literature mainly focuses on consumer new product adoption while other dimensions of consumer purchasing behaviors are largely ignored. In addition, the dynamics of spatial proximity effect, the multi-dimensional nature of spatial proximity, and its heterogeneous impact remain understudied. Based on social influence theory and social identity theory, we examine these research questions using a unique dataset from the top shopping website in  Hong Kong. Our study shows that non-cumulative consumer density and cumulative consumer density have an opposite impact on consumers’ online purchasing behavior (when and how much to buy), and such an effect is dynamically changing over time. Further, there exists significant heterogeneity across different product categories and consumers. Our proposed framework also allows us to identify the drivers of the dynamic spatial proximity effect. As a result, this study provides novel findings on the dynamics and heterogeneity of the spatial proximity effect and offers important theoretical and managerial implications for marketing researchers and managers.
