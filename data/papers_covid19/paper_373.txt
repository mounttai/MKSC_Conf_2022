3 - Consumption Responses to an Unpopular Policy: Evidence from a Short-lived Soda Tax Andrew Ching, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD Public policies that intervene or restrict consumer choices for the benefit of society are often controversial. For instance, the compliance rate of COVID-19 pandemic social distancing rules varied dramatically across cities and states, and these policies even backfired among some consumers who strongly disagreed with them. Motivated by these controversies, we investigate whether such rebellion behavior happens in the context of a soda tax. More specifically, we hypothesize that  tax opponents will decrease their consumption of soda by more compared to tax supporters, in order to avoid the tax burden. We combine detailed voting records with price and quantity data at over a thousand grocery retailers, and show that in response to the short-lived Washington State soda tax, stores frequented by tax opponents experience twice the reduction in quantity sold of taxed beverages compared to stores frequented by tax supporters, even though the tax pass-through is uniform across all stores. Our estimation results show that demand for soda at tax opponentsâ€™ stores shifts inwards and becomes less elastic, supporting the behavioral interpretation that consumer disagreement with this policy induces tax avoidance.
