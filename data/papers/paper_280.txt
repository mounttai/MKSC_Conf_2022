2 - Does Emotional Matching Between Video Content and Advertising Lead to Better Ad Engagement? Evidence from a Large Scale Field Experiment Anuj Kapoor, IIM Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad, India Sridhar Narayanan Video advertising platforms allow for a high degree of targeting of ads based on factors such as consumer demographics, their behaviors and the topics of the content on which the ad is shown. In this study, we examine the impact of matching the emotional content of ads with the content on which they are shown. Behavioral research has ambiguous predictions on the effect of such matching on ad engagement by the consumer and downstream actions such as clicks and purchases. On the one hand, matching has been found to lead to greater fluency on the part of the consumer and better persuasion, and this extend to matching on emotions as well. On the other hand, unmatched ads could lead to greater attention from the consumer due to emotional contrast. Thus, whether matching leads to greater or lower engagement is an empirical questions. We conduct a large-scale field experiment in collaboration with a video/ ad serving platform. For a large set of users, we randomize the video and ad they are shown - specifically we classify a set of videos and ads as happy or sad, and randomize which combination of video and ad is shown to the consumer. This allows us to causally examine the impact of emotional matching of ads and video content in the field. Our main  finding is that unmatched ads lead to better engagement, but there is important heterogeneity in these effects. We next examine the mechanism questions and find support for the argument that such ads lead to greater attention and this in turn drives engagement by the consumers. Our findings are important extend our understanding of matching to the question of emotions, and are useful to firms thinking about how to target their ads.
