1 - Why Are Revenue Contracts So Ubiquitous? Kissan Joseph, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS Murali Mantrala, Paul Parker, Alex Thevaranjan Sales organizations seek margins but often reward revenue. This disconnect is puzzling and has not escaped commentary. Accordingly, in this research, we ask: what metric should compensation contracts be based on: margins, revenue, or separate commissions for price and quantity? We develop a two-effort model where the first effort (quality) helps the salesperson garner a high price whereas the second effort (quantity) drives the number of customer transactions. We obtain three key results. First, when the salesperson does not control price, margin contracts are equivalent to revenue contracts in terms of efforts and profits. Second, we offer a conditional insight. In high value-added consultative environments, firms concerned about the adverse impact of negotiations may actually prefer revenue contracts because the fractional profit degradation of revenue contracts could well be lower than the fractional loss from negotiations. In contrast, firms concerned about the fixed cost of collecting margin information may prefer margin contracts because the absolute profit degradation of revenue contracts could likely exceed this fixed cost. Finally, we demonstrate that separate commissions on price and quantity perform  substantially worse than either a margin contract or a revenue contract. Even though its ability to precisely control each effort might, at first blush, seem to be an ideal theoretical solution, the choices of the salesperson here with respect to price and quantity are too far removed from the margin optimization desired by the firm. We believe this last finding parallels the double marginalization finding reported in the channel literature.
