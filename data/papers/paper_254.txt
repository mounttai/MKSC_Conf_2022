4 - Foe or Friend: Flat-rate Pricing and Market Outcome in the Ride-hailing Market Wei Miao, Assistant Professor, University College London, London, United Kingdom Junhong Chu Flat-rate pricing has become increasingly popular in the ride-hailing industry. We take advantage of a policy change in which a leading ride-hailing company in Singapore introduced an origin-destination-based flat-fare option to study the causal effects of flat-rate pricing on drivers’ shift income, labor supply, as well as riders’ welfare. With a series of generalized difference-in-differences analyses, we find that the introduction of flat-rate pricing led to higher shift income for drivers. Our mechanism analyses further show that the increased shift income was not due to changes in the extensive margin of drivers’ labor supply: Affected drivers did not extend their shift hours; rather, it was caused by the improvement over drivers’ intensive margin of labor supply: The flat-rate option incentivized drivers to take more efficient routes with shorter durations on both flat-rate trips and metered trips, and the saved driving time enabled drivers to take more trips without needing to extend shift hours nor reduce break time. Meanwhile, flat-rate option also improves riders’ welfare because riders can now reach their destinations faster without being detoured. This suggests that flat-rate pricing was not a zero-sum game between drivers and riders but a win-win strategy for both sides of the ride-hailing market.
