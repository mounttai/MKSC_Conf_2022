1 - Impact of Unexpected Outcome in Election on Consumer Variety Seeking Behaviors Hamzeh Rayej, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada SunAh Kim, Ohjin Kwon Studies in psychology and neuroscience have documented that unexpected outcomes along with prediction error (e.g., unexpected political outcomes) can affect exploratory and risk-taking behavior. It also suggests that the unexpectedness of an event can amplify the mood. We empirically study whether and how an unexpected outcome could shift  consumer choice behavior using a political event as a context. Using the Nielsen Homescan panel dataset and employing a difference-in-difference quasi-experimental method, we examine the impact of Donald Trump’s surprising win in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on households’ brand variety-seeking and new brand adoptions. Consistent with prediction error literature, the unexpected outcomes of the election significantly influence household choice behavior, and political ideology moderates this relationship. Our empirical results show that Trump’s unexpected win increased variety seeking and new brand adoptions by conservative households than liberals. We rule out alternative mechanisms that these findings are driven by price promotion and change in the category expenditure. We check the robustness of our results using various assumptions including falsification tests. We discuss the implications of this research for retailers and brand managers.
