4 - Aggregate Review Metrics vs. Individual Reviews: How do They Affect Risk Perception and Product Judgment? Caner Cesmeci, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey Sebnem Burnaz This research examines how consumers use aggregate review metrics (ARM) (e.g., average ratings) and individual reviews (IR) (e.g., review texts) to estimate the risk perception and make a judgment about a product. First, we provide a novel conceptualization of ARM as a base rate cue, consisting of  abstract, aggregated, category-level, and pallid elements; likewise, IR as a case information cue, consisting of concrete, idiosyncratic, and vivid elements. In this sense, drawing on construal level theory, we suggest that consumers’ reliance on ARM (IR) will be enhanced (weakened) by psychological distance. The research includes two studies. First, a list of elements that influence relative importance of the cue types (i.e., ARM vs. IR) on consumer decision-making is compiled using the critical incident technique. Then, to test our hypothesis, an experimental study is designed. Psychological distance is manipulated via two scenarios signaling a purchase for self vs. others. Overall, the findings provide initial evidence that consumers’ utilization of IR (ARM) is increased (decreased) when purchasing a product for themselves. Contrarily, consumers’ utilization of ARM (IR) is increased (decreased) when purchasing a product for others. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first conceptual and empirical study that investigates relative importance of ARM and IR on perceived risk and product judgment in light of construal level theory. Early findings contribute to the existing literature of eWOM and construal level theory, as well as provide novel insights for managers as to prioritization of cue types (i.e., ARM vs. IR) in line with psychological distance of consumers.
