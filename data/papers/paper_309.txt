1 - Adaptive Experimentation for Pricing for Random Utility Model Lalit Jain, University of Washington, Seattle, WA Hema Yoganarasimhan We consider the problem of setting the optimal prices and marketing mix variables for a large number of products. At each time a customer arrives and chooses a product based on a multinomial discrete choice model with utilities depending on the prices of the products, and the marketing allocation. Using a Thompson Sampling approach, we develop a regret minimizing, alternatively profit maximizing, algorithm for the seller. Our work is the first practical approach for dynamic pricing for the discrete choice model that allows for a continuous set of potential price vectors. In addition, our model of marketing allocation provides a new model for assortment selection problems. Using both synthetic simulations, and simulations based on real-life grocery store data, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. We also provide theoretical justification of our result and improve upon existing regret guarantees.
