2 - Where Does the Sales of Sustainable New Products Come From?: New, Competitive, and Cannibalized Growth Youngtak M. Kim, University of Georgia, Athens, GA Sundar G Bharadwaj Sustainable is no longer a strategic differentiator but a necessity. Consumer demand for sustainable products is growing and serving as key drivers of sales growth. As a result, companies have greater incentives to create sustainable products that serve the needs of consumers and societal (environmental and social) good to increase firm value. However, the corporate sustainability and social responsibility literature in marketing is limited to studies that observe firm-level initiatives with fewer implications at the brand and product level. Therefore, this study seeks to understand how sustainable new products influence the offerings of a brand using a demand decomposition approach. Using retail scanner data, we decompose the demand of sustainable new products to determine if they serve as sources of new (market  expansion), competitive (substitution), or cannibalized growth. In addition, we observe the effects of the marketing mix elements and product moderators (certification, convenience, quality) that serve as contingencies. This offers theoretical and practical insights when considering the launch of sustainable new products.
