3 - Influencing the Influencer with Consumer Bias Luying Wang, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China Yunchuan Liu We study the effects of consumer bias on marketer engagement in word of mouth. Influencer posts product review to followers of different beliefs and allows sponsorship from marketer for product promotion. We set up a game theory model to formulate the interaction between firm and influencer. We also use Bayesian persuasion with multiple receivers to model the effect of influencer’s product review on consumers’ belief updating. Our results suggest that consumer heterogeneity plays an important role in marketer’s engagement in influencing marketing on sponsorship volume and product sales. Improved marketing efficiency is achieved through the endogeny of consumer prior belief from homogeneity to heterogeneity. A marketer may strategically target consumer segments based on consumer bias on prior belief through announcing sponsorship disclosure extent in influencer’s review. Interestingly, marketer partially sponsors influencer is optimal even if consumer’s prior belief is at a high level and marketer partially sponsors influencer is optimal even though consumer’s prior belief is at a low level. Sometimes even consumer’s belief shows a positive bias on product, the marketer may still be hurt from a higher sponsorship to increase influencer’s incentive to post review.  Counter intuitively, we find sometimes consumer’s positive bias may hurt the firm but benefit consumers even the actual product fit isn’t high enough.
