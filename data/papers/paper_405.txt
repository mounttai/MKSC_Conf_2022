3 - Analyzing users’ Posting Behavior on a Q & A Website using LDA and BTYD Model Shohei Hasegawa, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan In the case of contractual services, customer withdrawals can be observed when the customer terminates the contract, whereas in the case of non-contractual services, those cannot be observed directly. For example, in a subscription service, which is a contractual service, the firm can observe a customer withdrawal if the customer stops to pay a monthly fee. However, in an e-commerce site, which is a non-contractual service, the firm cannot observe a customer withdrawal if the customer stops using the service or switches to competitors. BTYD (Buy Till You Die) model is a statistics model to analyze these non-contractual settings and estimate customer’s withdrawal status and CLV (Customer Lifetime Value). In this paper, the author analyzes data from a Q&A website for mothers to solve questions about everything from pregnancy to childcare. This service is non-contractual-based and users’ posting dates and texts can be observed, but users’ withdrawal cannot be observed. The purposes of this research are to (1) model users’ posting behavior and withdrawal by BTYD model, (2) predict the number of future posts, i.e., the amount of content generated by users, (3) extract the users’ interests from their posted texts by LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) , and (4) analyze the relationship between the users’ interests and the users’ posting behavior, withdrawal and the number of future posts. The analysis results show that users who are interested in pregnancy post more questions but withdraw from the service earlier than others, implying that these users stop using the service after the birth of the baby. In order to retain these users, it would be effective to provide incentive to encourage them to continue using the service after giving birth.
