1 - Pricing and Advertising Decisions for New Prescription Drugs Guneet Kaur Nagpal, Western University, London, ON, Canada Rajdeep Grewal, Deepak Jena, Atul Nerkar Taking the context of newly launched branded prescription drugs, we study the new product optimal advertising and pricing strategies in the presence of patents. One can argue that for prescription drugs protected by patents, which create competitive barriers, drugs may enter the market as monopoly offering and hence may have significant pricing power with reduced the reliance on advertising spends  as a differentiation or quality signaling tool. The empirical investigation of this argument remains elusive in the extant literature on new prescription drug launches. Consequently, we analytically develop and empirically estimate the simultaneous pricing and advertising spends equations using 328 newly launched branded prescription drugs introduced in the U.S. market during 1984-2003. We find that when drugs have longer time to exercise pricing power, firms tend to be relatively generous in bearing advertising costs; and when drugs have broader patent portfolio, firms tend to collect higher economic gains early on by charging higher prices. Further, advertising spends and prices are negatively associated, implying market penetration role of advertising spends at the time of drug launch. We also find that drug superiority factors relate positively to price and advertising spends, and that that firmâ€™s reliance on patents as pricing power tool and advertising spends reduces if the drug has higher efficacy and broader benefit scope respectively
