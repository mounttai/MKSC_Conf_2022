2 - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Promotions Xueming Luo, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA Wen Wang, Beibei Li Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has opened up many unprecedented opportunities in revolutionizing the  digital marketing field. In this study, we designed a DRL- based personalized targeting strategy in a sequentialsetting. We show that the strategy is able to address three important challenges of sequential targeting. 1)Forward-looking: balancing between a firmâ€™s current revenue and future revenues; 2) Earning-while-learning:maximizing profits while continuously learning through exploration-exploitation; 3) Scalability: coping with ahigh-dimensional state and policy space. We illustrate the above through a novel design of a DRL-basedartificial intelligence (AI) agent. To better adapt DRL to complex consumer behavior dimensions, we proposeda quantization-based uncertainty learning heuristic for efficient exploration-exploitation. Our policy evaluationresults through simulation suggest that the proposed DRL agent generates 26.75% more long-term revenuesthan can the non-DRL approaches on average, and learns 76.92% faster than the second fastest model amongall benchmarks.
