4 - Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication: Price Match vs. Reinforcement Learning Yan Huang, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA Qiaochu Wang, Param Vir Singh Retailers are increasingly using pricing algorithms to automatically update their prices to improve profit. Reinforcement learning (RL) based pricing algorithms are particularly appealing for this purpose because they can autonomously learn an optimal pricing policy that best responds to competitors’ price changes without prior knowledge of the competitors’ strategies and the market environment and, more importantly, can adapt to any evolution in competitors’ pricing strategy. It is commonly believed that sophisticated RL based algorithms have a significant advantage over simple rule-based pricing algorithms; therefore, in a competitive environment, firms should also adopt RL based pricing if their competitors are using such algorithms. However, through extensive pricing experiments in a model of repeated price competition, we show that a firm’s best response to its competitor’s sophisticated RL based algorithms is to use simple rule-based pricing algorithms, such as price match. In fact, price match dominates RL, supervised learning, and multi-armed bandit based pricing strategies as a response to the competitor’s RL algorithm. The results hold when the products offered by the competing firms are either identical or horizontally differentiated. We provide theoretical rationale and empirical evidence to explain the dominance of price match and discuss policy implications.
