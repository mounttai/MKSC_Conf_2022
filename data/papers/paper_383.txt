2 - Online Review Text Analysis Incorporating Valence and Vote: Extending the Topic Model to Include Performance Measures Sotaro Katsumata, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan Pallassana K Kannan In this study, we developed a model to classify and evaluate the topics of online reviews by including not only the text of the review but also the products’ valence (evaluation score), which is given from multiple perspectives by reviewers, and the votes of other viewers that the review was helpful. Regarding valence and vote, several studies have presented models to analyze valence and text simultaneously, but to make effective use of CGM data, it is necessary to consider the information of vote, which is the quality of the review itself, together. Therefore, in this study, we present a topic model including valence and vote mentioned above in the text analysis of consumer reviews and adapt it to long-term review data. Especially, we aim to develop a model that can be estimated as stably as possible using LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) as the base model. Our model is based on the LDA, but a conjugate distribution is assumed for the review scores and the number of votes to obtain stable estimation results. The model is applied to an actual review database. As objects of analysis, this study focuses on two product series, the iPhone series manufactured by Apple Inc, and Dyson’s handheld vacuum cleaner series. In the application to the actual review database, we confirmed that topics can be interpreted by referring to valence and vote in the evaluation of topics after classification. In addition, we estimated and discussed the factors that determine the probability of affiliation for topics that attract many viewers.
