3 - Dynamic Pricing Under Adoption with Survival Bias Harry Zihao Zhou, University College London, London, United Kingdom We study how a firm launching a new product could use its dynamic pricing decisions to influence how consumers learn about the product’s quality. In our model, the firm faces the trade-off between adoption and future per-sale revenue. The main result of our model predicts that the firm’s pricing decisions have two stages: reputation building and expansion. In the reputation-building stage, as the perceived quality of the product improves, the firm gradually raises its price in order to encourage consumer learning. Once the product is well-thought enough, the product enters its expansion stage, where the firm cuts its price to discourage consumer learning, and the price path becomes constant to achieve optimal adoption.
