3 - Be Careful What You Look for: Biased Brand Portrayal in Social Media Julia Rosada, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany Jochen Hartmann, Jasper Schwenzow, Mark Heitmann User attention in social media has long shifted from text to images. These images often contain brand logos in various intended but also unintended contexts. The amount of such brand imagery continues to proliferate, making it challenging for marketing research and practice to keep track of how brands appear online. The most intuitive approach is to search brand hashtags (e.g., #heineken) and study all related images. However, less than 20% of branded user-generated content contains a brand hashtag, leaving the remaining 80% unconsidered. To investigate a potential bias, we use deep convolutional neural networks for image classification and object detection and analyze more than 200,000 brand image posts with and without hashtags, originating from Twitter, covering more than 150 brands. We find that users are more likely to add hashtags to images with bigger and more central logos as well as to those with higher quality image characteristics (e.g., saturation, brightness). Conversely, objects on the image that compete with brand visibility result in fewer hashtags. These differences have consequences in terms of viewer response. Specifically, a lab experiment suggests that the types of images consumers typically tag obtain higher purchase-intention ratings compared to the types of images that remain untagged. We also find that brands have differential hashtag potential such that brands with higher levels of user interest feature a higher share of hashtag images. We discuss the relevance of scalable logo detection to remedy the resulting biases of social media data collection.
