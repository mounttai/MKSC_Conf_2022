2 - Exploring Consumers’ Need to Own Richard Chau, Doctoral Student, Pepperdine University Graziadio Business School, Malibu, CA Joy L. Shields, Doreen E. Shanahan, Cristel A. Russell This project advances a nomological network and embarks on scale development to better capture the definition and dimensionality of the ‘need to own’ construct. Although some predicted the End of Ownership (Perzanowski and Schultz 2017), research suggests there are systematic individual differences such as intelligence (Aspara and Wittkowski 2019) that may drive consumers toward more liquid forms of consumption. Or, having a strong sense that something is mine increases consumers’ territorial tendencies (Kirk, Peck, and Swain 2018). Research on deownership orientation shows that some individuals are more willing to rent or lend than to own (Lindblom and Lindblom 2016). Yet, consumers with high deownership orientation are more likely to have compulsive and impulsive digital acquisition tendencies (Koklic, Kukar-Kinney, and Vida 2022). Hence, as Lamberton and Goldsmith (2020) suggest, there may be innate antecedents of tendencies toward solid ownership. Following the 21st century’s regained enthusiasm for the study of basic psychological needs (Vansteenkiste, Ryan, and Soenens 2020), we explore whether a trait-like disposition such as ‘need to own’ may transcend existing notions of materialism and whether consumers vary in their tendencies to be the sole owner of tangible or digital objects. The first phase of our study included qualitative interviews with consumer dyads, people in a relationship. We constructed a deep nomological network for how consumers’ ‘need to own’ relates to other central constructs at the intersection of possessing/owning and liquid/solid. The second phase will be  the item generation and testing phase followed by a series of studies designed to assess the reliability and validity of the newly developed measure.
