4 - Winning the Attention Race: Analyzing Video Popularity and Content Evolution on TikTok Zijun Tian, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA Ryan Dew, Raghuram Iyengar We explore the empirical regularities governing the diffusion of content on the recently popular social media platform TikTok, including video and hashtag-level drivers of content popularity. TikTok is a unique social media platform focused  on the sharing of short videos. Similar to social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok features hashtags that organize user generated content. However, unlike other social media platforms, TikTok also features a special type of hashtag, the challenge, that encourages users to generate (rather than merely share) content matching a particular theme. Combining both classical ideas from the literature on diffusion on social networks with cutting-edge multiview representation learning methods, we explore how these challenges grow in popularity, what factors explain the popularity of both challenges and videos within them, and how the content within hashtags evolves over time. These insights have implications for firm management of social media campaigns.
