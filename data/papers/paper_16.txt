3 - How do Customer Relationships Evolve? Evidence from Touchpoint Dynamics Roelof Hars, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Hans Risselada, Jaap Wieringa  Understanding how existing customer relationships evolve is a key goal for marketing managers interested in learning how customers should be approached at any given time. Prior work has identified that relationships go through different states, and has studied how touchpoints serve as relationship signals by affecting the transition between these states. In this paper, the authors show that the effects of touchpoints on relationship evolution are heterogeneous. This makes it difficult for managers to identify what the use of a touchpoint says about a specific customer’s motivation and future trajectory, especially in business-to-customer settings. Using a customer journey lens, the authors estimate a state space model on a unique longitudinal dataset containing over three years of daily data of 10.000 customers in the insurance industry, and find that past touchpoints visited by a customer moderate the effect of later touchpoints. The authors show that including a customer’s prior journey adds important contextual information which aids in the prediction of relationship evolution and improves firms’ capacity to understand the ‘signal value’ present in customer touchpoint use.
