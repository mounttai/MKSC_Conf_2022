1 - The Value of Referral: Referral and Purchase in Direct Selling Maiju Guo, Peking University, Beijing, China Qiaowei Shen, Hongju Liu Referrals have been detected as the most important source of gaining new customers. Direct selling firms offer an opportunity for existing consumers to become producers after making successful referrals and track the referral provider and referral receiver relationship more accurately. Such firms’ performance critically depends on the purchase and referral performance of existing customers, which determines the customer’s overall contribution margin. This paper examines the role of referral in interactive and dynamic business settings. Using a novel data set from a large direct selling  company, we construct four focal variables-referral provider’s and receiver’s referral and purchase, respectively. To account for the possibility that the focal variables influence each other, we estimate a panel vector autoregression model on data at the month level from 4677 users. The results suggest that users’ referral strengthens their purchase, but their purchase has no significant impact on referral. In addition, users’ referral boosts more referral and purchase of their referred users. Moreover, users’ purchase negatively impacts the referral but not the purchase of their referred users. Our results shed important managerial insights on how platforms can optimize marketing interventions such as referral encouragement and quantify customer referral value.
