3 - Effect of Brand Advertising on Purchase Funnel: Impact and Mechanism in the Messy Middle Thyagarajan Subramanian, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX B.P.S. Murthi In digital marketing, performance-based advertising is a dominant strategy as it relies on observable metrics such as cost per click and cost per action to allocate advertising budgets. These campaigns focus on information and call to action. In contrast, brand advertising uses television, outdoor, and other rich media. Brand advertising uses emotions, imagery, and symbolism for positioning. Both types of advertising can influence different stages of the consumer purchase funnel, from brand awareness, consideration, preference to its eventual purchase and repurchase. However, extant literature has not studied the effect of brand advertising on different stages of the observed purchase funnel. This study uses a unique data set from a natural experiment to learn how brand advertising affects different stages in a purchase funnel for a digital platform that provides app-based food delivery from local restaurants. We propose a conceptual model of how advertising impacts emotion- driven choice. First, we use regression discontinuity in time to measure the impact of brand advertising on the middle of the funnel - consideration and preference. Next, we use brand track surveys measuring changes in perception and a deep learning analysis of social media conversations to explain how advertising affects emotional preference building. This study is the first to show that brand advertising increases both consideration and preference by 10% and 12%, respectively, even after prolonged previous exposure to performance ads. We observe that a brand-building campaign is different in its effectiveness on various stages of the purchase funnel relative to performance advertising. This study will guide managers to select suitable campaign approaches for different stages of the consumer purchase funnel.
