2 - Brand-Influencer Collaborations and Change in Content Strategy Anwesha De, Bocconi University, Milano, Italy Beth Fossen With the rapid rise in the number of social media users and the increase in the amount of time spent on social media, social media platforms present brands with a more dynamic and interactive platform to engage consumers. However, despite the increasing investments in social media over recent years, there are concerns about the contribution of these investments to firm performance. While literature highlights the importance of social media influencer marketing for marketers, research on the consequences of such brand-influencer collaborations is still nascent. In this paper, we focus on the influencerâ€™s content strategy in the brand-influencer relationship. While such a change in content strategy by influencers may be driven by the motivation to increase engagement, it may potentially have severe  repercussions. Using data from 75 social media influencers across three industries, we investigate the impacts of brand- influencer collaborations and changes in content strategy on engagement. We find that when influencers mention brands in their posts, they see a decrease in engagement. Moreover, we show that influencers tend to change their content strategy in terms of the arousal expressed in the language when they post branded content. We find that when influencers change the arousal of their content when posting about brands, this further reduces engagement both in terms of the number of shares and replies. We probe the mechanism driving this negative relationship and find evidence that changes in content strategy by influencers may come across as overly promotional and trigger persuasion knowledge in followers.
