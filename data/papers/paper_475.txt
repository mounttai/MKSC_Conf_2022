4 - The Value of Logistic Flexibility in Online Retailing Bing Bai, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO Tat Y Chan, Dennis J Zhang, Fuqiang Zhang In recent years, improving shipping speed in online retailing has faced significant diminishing marginal returns and significant cost increases. As a consequence, many online retailers have started to explore improving other aspects of the shipping experience to attract customers. In this paper, we use the introduction of local pick-up stations by Alibaba to study the impact of improving logistic flexibility on online retailing. We find that the impact of pick-up stations on order frequency is 3.1%, which also drives GMV to increase. Though past literature focuses on shipping speed in e-commerce logistics, we show that the speed effect is not the driving factor on the impact of pick-up stations. Instead, the flexibility introduced by pick-up stations mediates the sales impact. To examine customers’ preferences on e-commerce logistics, we develop a choice model to study how logistic flexibility affects customers’ purchase decisions. We find that customers value two types of logistic flexibility -- the value of time flexibility, which offers them the flexibility to receive their packages in their most preferred time; and the value of choice flexibility, which offers them the flexibility to make pick-up choices until the last minute to accommodate time uncertainty. We also find that to increase customers’ value of logistic flexibility, the platform can reallocate non-pickup orders’ delivery time window within districts, which would further boost order frequency.
