2 - The Impact of Co-branded Credit Card Adoption on Customer Loyalty Nan Zhao, Washington University in St.Louis, St Louis, MO Arun Gopalakrishnan, Chakravarthi Narasimhan We study how the adoption of co-branded credit card affects customer behaviors and loyalty using a comprehensive longitudinal dataset from a North American airline. To mitigate the challenge of selection bias, we use a multi- pronged strategy that includes propensity score matching of card adopters and non-adopters using a battery of behavioral and demographic variables, as well as difference- in-differences analysis with appropriate individual and time fixed effects. We also explore possible selection due to unobservables by estimating effects beyond immediate adoption and heterogeneous treatment effects across segments that may differ in the unobservables that drive selection. We find that card adoption increased flight spend and number of flights taken on the airline in the short-, medium-, and longer-term. We also find an increase in loyalty program behaviors due to card adoption including loyalty miles earned and redeemed with the focal airline.
